How did I end up right here with you
After all the things that I been through
It's been one of those days
You try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out
Let's get right
Now that I'm here baby

Show me a good time
(oh yeah, oh yeah)
Show me a good time
(oh yeah, oh yeah)
Show me a good
Show me a good
Show me a good time
(oh yeah, oh yeah)

I live for the nights that I can't remember
With the people that I won't forget
Spending all the money I just work my ass off
For doing things that I won't regret

I've been waiting way too long long long long
Tellin' everybody that I know we about to be on on on on
I ain't tryna look like I lie to these niggas that I came up with
That's my team,
never would I let a woman come between
What we doing right now
This our dream,
Wu Tang Clan niggas want that cream

I'm the Osiris of the shit right now
Go to guy for the hits right now
Whatever you wanna drink girl pick right now
If you can't hold your liquor, better quit right now

How did I end up right here with you
After all the things that I been through
It's been one of those days
You try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out
Let's get right
Now that I'm here baby

Show me a good time
(oh yeah, oh yeah)
Show me a good time
(oh yeah, oh yeah)
Show me a good
Show me a good
Show me a good time
(oh yeah, oh yeah)

How 'bout you and all your morals
in that outfit that you borrowed
Make the most out of tonight
and worry bout it all tomorrow

Understand girl, we fam girl
Can't get me right and not do Wayne
Cash money young money pop champagne
Presidential suite girl Barack Hussein

Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg
People really hate when a backpack rapper get rich
And start livin' that life dawg
Feels like when you get into that paper hip hop hates ya
They would do it just like I do if they could
It's in our nature

Ah, young and rich and out of control
Out in LA blowing clouds of the killer
I came up in the underground though
So I'mma spend another ten thousand for Dilla

Call me over-rated or created or too jaded
Because any way you put it bitch I made it, YUP

How did I end up right here with you
After all the things that I been through
It's been one of those days
You try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out
Let's get right
Now that I'm here baby

Show me a good time
(oh yeah, oh yeah)
Show me a good time
(oh yeah, oh yeah)
Show me a good
Show me a good
Show me a good time
(oh yeah, oh yeah)
