You would think it's all mine the way I took it
You would think it broke down the way I push it
You hate it when I coat things all in sugar
You want to hear the real talk, well, girl, who wouldn't?

Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?

Have you coming all summer like a season pass
I want to turn you out like pitch black
Want to watch you do work while I sit back
Cause you talk like you got what I need
You talk like you got the juice and the squeeze
Talk like you bet it all on me
And you can't take no L's off me

Over and over and over and over and over again
Now you're coming over

I been on all the floors of your ego
Feel like I was slipping away
And you know that I ain't gonna go, ain't gonna go nowhere, nowhere
Cause some of these things never change, no, no
I know that you know, that you know, you know that's it's true
There's a lot on my mind and you bother the times that I  with you
But we keep it way more way more than, way more than 100, we keep it 110
Show me what I gotta do

I know you been working, working, working, working, ain't ya?

And before you leave here (I need you to cum)
And until you do babe (don't you leave)
Ain't about me no more (need you to know)
Tonight I'll make sure (you cum before me)
And before you leave here (I need you to cum)
But before you do (don't you leave)
It ain't about me no more (need you to know)
Make sure you (cum before me)

Get you on top of me
We can do this still, probably
Get your hands in the air, do your hair back
You're like a winning ticket off the lottery
But you don't, yeah, you don't want to start on me
Yeah, you don't want to start with me
But you should, keep shaking that in front of me
She gotta be with the squad for me
You know, you know you gon' get comfortable
On the  rug with me
And fuck with me
So if you really fuck with me
Cause I can see that you're with  I know your snapchat
Let's see these legs down
And it makes so much sense now (I need you to cum)
Girl it makes so much sense now (told you to leave)
You know that I'm gon' make sure now (need you to know)
Make sure, make sure (cum before me)
Make sure, make sure (I need you to cum)
Make sure, make sure (told you to leave)
You know I gotta make sure, gotta make sure (need you to know)
Make sure, make sure (cum before me)
