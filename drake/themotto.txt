I'm the fuckin' man, you don't get it do ya?
Type of money everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City bitch
Some Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami too
Clubbing hard, fuckin' women there ain't much to do

Wrist blang, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel? how you feel? how you feel?
Twenty five sittin' on 25 mil uh
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'mma do it for the Bay, okay
Getting paid we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune "light one, pass it like a relay"
YMCMB you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, Marley Marl at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shout to Gibbo
We got Santa Margarita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
Aoh, that's how you feel man?
That's really how you feel?
'Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't
Then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal,
Real nigga what's up?

Now she want a photo
You already know though
You only live once: that's the motto nigga YOLO and
We bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way
Real nigga what's up?

One, time fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven, grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO add a B to that shit
I'm fucked-up, tore-down
I'm twisted: door knob
Talk stupid, off with your head!
Nigga money talks and Mr Ed! Yea!
I'm so Young Money got a drum on the gun
Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi

Now she want a photo
You already know though
You only live once: that's the motto nigga YOLO and
We bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sitting on the bench, nigga we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way
Real nigga what's up

T Raw, skinny nigga big balls
Fuck around get dragged, Ru Paul
You a funny little nigga, Duval
Out of this world, Total Recall
Call a bitch raw dick let her see-saw
Sorta like a donkey like an ass nigga he-haw
Riding round in the 'rari with the top off
While you in the window man I'm probably on my next car
Ay! Mighty duck with the ice on
Real L.A. nigga trucks with the gun drawn
Drawing on your face you a clown jack in the box
Boy that's your bop she my new poom poom star
Stars in the back and my homies they don't act
Acting brand new fuck her never call her back
Matt Forte got the bitch running back
Man that's the motto you ain't know it's like that?

Now she want a photo
You already know though
You only live once: that's the motto nigga YOLO and
We bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sitting on the bench, nigga we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way
Real nigga what's up what's up what's up
Real nigga what's up what's up what's up
Real nigga what's up what's up what's up
