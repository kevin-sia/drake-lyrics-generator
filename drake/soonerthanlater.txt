I forgot to call you on your birthday
You swear you're the last thing on my mind
There is nothing I could do to fix it
All you ever asked me for was time

When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you tell me you're in love with someone else

So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together, make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever
And I realized I waited too long
But please don't move on

You don't need no one else 
You don't need no one else 
You don't need no one else 
You don't need no one else 
You don't need no one else 

You just changed your hair and it looks perfect
Wish I was the first to let you know
Every chance I get to make it better
I just find a way to let it go

When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you tell me you're in love with someone else

So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together, make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever
And I realized I waited too long
But please don't move on

You don't need no one else 
You don't need no one else 
You don't need no one else 
You don't need no one else 
You don't need no one else 

The girl or the world?
You see: someone gotta lose
I thought I could have it all
Do I really got to choose?

What good is all the cash, if it doesn't buy time?
And what good is being famous, if I'm never on your mind?

Night's fallen, light's glowing
And I'm just trying to pay the price owing
And I don't wanna feel the comfort for my ice showing
And I ain't tryna be without you at the right moments
Nigga nice going

Is it worth it? That decision?
'Cause hearts break and I ain't tryna be in that collision
So I'mma dust my shirt and fix my pants
'Cause I better look good, girl
If this my chance I swear

So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever
And I realized I waited too long
But please don't move on

You don't need no one else 
You don't need no one else 
You don't need no one else 
You don't need no one else 
You don't need no one else
