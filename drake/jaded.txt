Ayy, yeah
Dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
Yeah

Leaving me (leaving me)
Dippin' out on me (on me)
Already got what you needed, I guess
Quickly (quickly) learned yourself through me (through me)
Already gave you what you needed, I guess (ooh, yeah)
I guess, (yeah) yeah
That's why I'm not with nobody (ooh, yeah)
'Cause I don't wanna hurt nobody (ooh, yeah)
Did it over text, didn't call me (ooh, yeah)
Still got love for you, mami
I know you wanna be somebody (body)
Even if you gotta leave somebody, yeah

Yes I'm hurting, yes I'm jaded (jaded)
Most of these things, I don't wanna say (jaded)
I wanna be around while you chasin' (while you chasin' it)
You wanna hit me up when you make it
You'll try and come back when you famous
I always want the truth, but it's dangerous (dangerous, oh)
You got something real, not basic (ooh, yeah)
You wanna get with me, stop
Yes I'm hurting, yes I'm jaded (jaded)
Most of these things, I don't wanna say (say)
I wanna be around while you chasin' (wanna be around, wanna be around)
You wanna hit me up when you make it (ooh, yeah)
You'll try and come back when you famous (back around, back around)
I always want the truth, but it's dangerous (dangerous)
You got something real, not basic
You wanna get with me, stop (playin')

Yeah
Dogs on this side, dogs over on this side (ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
Ayy
Told me about all your insecurities, for what?
Dragged me like two hours to your family's house, for what?
Said you need some time, but I should stick around, for what?
Always felt like stickin' 'round's the same as being stuck
And like guns with the inkin', you're getting under my skin
Pretty little young thing (young thing)
Had a nigga convinced, got me too excited
Yeah
You played me
You played me, you played me
Low down, dirty
Shameful, crazy
I need to know how the new nigga you got does the same thing
I do for a living but is way less wavy
How you even managin' to keep straight faces in all the pictures that I seen lately
Lord knows you still look amazing
That's besides the point I'm making
You're way too opinionated, have to force it, have to fake it
You have potential, I could've shaped it
You went and caved in (ooh, yeah)
We could've waited
I wasn't rushing
Differences in ages
You're old enough, but you're still a baby
You've shared stories where you did amazin'
Things to be loyal, things to be patient
That was before me, I must've changed it
Shifted your focus, lens lookin' jaded (jaded)

Most of these things, I don't wanna say
I wanna be around while you chasin' (while you chasin')
You wanna hit me up when you make it
You'll try and come back when you famous (back around, back around)
Dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
You wanna get with me, stop (playin')
