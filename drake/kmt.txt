(Ness on the beat)
Yeah
Okay, okay
Okay

B Man just got out the can
I gave my bro an advance (yeah)
Love is just not in my plans
Not even takin' a chance
Studio right in my yard
I'm doin' ten in a week
How long I been on this streak?
Dream about work in my sleep
Okay, I got a lock on the streets
Shoutout to T, he did three
And he brought it in 'cause of me
You don't know nothin' 'bout me
Life for my bruddas is deep
Long as they all on they feet
Long as they pockets is grease (grease!)
I'm in the penthouse, but still nothin' is sweet (yeah)
Dust a man down with the pen, it's a sweep (Mmmm!)
Taller in person, you'll see when we meet
I heard your new shit and I'm kissin' my teeth
(Jheeze)

Bringin' that dirty, dirty, bringin' that certy
Nizzy with the quick extension, ringin' off thirty
I've got bitches and they're murky, swervin', lookin' all curvy
And you already know I love them breasts, lookin' all perky
Lookin' all Christmas gift-wrapped, lookin' all turkey
Spend jumped out the Ghost in a suit, lookin' all churchy
Fingers all itchin', twitchin', lookin' all jerky
Whippin' that white girl, cookin' that Cersei
I'm just pushin' that dark shit, pushin' that charcoal
Now this is that big bad, this is Gustavo
Look at them jokers, look at that arsehole
Man are gettin' bread now, this is that hard dough
Clap man, dominant murder
I'm a black man, government earner
Could've just slapped man, but he wanted it further
Batman, da-na-na-da-na
