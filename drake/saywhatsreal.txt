Why do I feel so alone
Like everybody passing through the studio is in character
As if he acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I don't have the heart to give these bitch niggaz the cue to go

So they stick around, kicking out feedback
And I entertain it as if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing I need back

But it's hard to think of them polite flows
When Stefano Pilati suits are your night clothes
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight close

Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full, now this shit just being lipo'd
Always said I'd say it all on the right track
But in this game you only lose when you fight back

Black-diamond bracelets,
Showing you the basics
I can't live and hold the camera
Someone got to tape this
I make hits and like a bitch that's married, I ain't miss
24 hours from greatness,
I'm that close

Don't ever forget the moment you began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los Angeles, Cabanas, or Atlanta South
Watching Hov's show, embarrassed to pull my camera out

And my mother embarrassed to pull my Phantom out
So I park about 5 houses down
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around

So she wonder where my mind is, account's in the minus
But yet I roll around the fucking city like your highness
Got niggaz reacting without a sinus
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless

And promoters tryna get me out to they club
And say I have fun, but I can't imagine how
'Cause I just see my ex-girl,
Standing with my next girl,
Standing with the girl that I'm fucking right now

And shit could get weird, unless they all down
And so I stay clear, we from a small town
And everybody talks, and everybody listen
And somehow the truth just always comes up missing

I've always been something that these labels can't buy
Especially if they tryna take a piece of my soul
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez, "Damn, Drake fly."
And he just be like, "Silly motherfucker, I know.
That was your bad, how could you pass up on 'em?
He just take them records and he gas up on 'em.
Wayne would probably put a million cash up on 'em.
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em."

Oh they did Po, at least they tried to
And that's what happen when you spitting what's inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
And they think they can market you however they decide to

Nah, but 40 told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
'Cause who have known me, would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest could've fooled me

Boy, and to my city I'm the 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy
I'm just not the social type and campus life is crazy

Understand, I could get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll
Sell that motherfucker to any rapper that I know

'Cause they need it much more than I ever will
I got new shit, I'm getting better still
Little niggaz put my name in they verses
'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal

Future said, "'Cause it's Ye shit you better kill."
And I think this got that making-of-a-legend feel
Problem with these other niggaz they ain't never real
Yeah, it's all I can say
