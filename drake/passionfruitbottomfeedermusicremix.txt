Too fire, that's where you go when I'm too dead and lonely
Why is it you run away when only (only)
I need you and you need me?
Boy, you know me, you know me
Showbiz, pulled us far apart but you're my favorite audience
Ooh and you applaud, you make me feel I'm a like a hit
Greatest ever lived, let's be passionate
Boy, don't run from this, I'm listening

Listen, seein' you got ritualistic (I know, I know)
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
'Cause I'm fallin' apart
(Fallin' apart, baby, don't fall apart)
Yep, tension between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won't mention for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
(Fallin' apart, baby, don't fall apart, passion)

Passionate from miles away (Passionate from mile away)
Passive with the things you say (Things I say)
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no (Please don't blame me now)
Passionate from miles away (Passionate from mile away)
Passive with the things you say (Things I say)
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no (Please don't blame me now)

Listen, hard at buildin' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
(Fallin' apart baby, don't fall apart)
Leavin', you're just doing that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart
(Fallin' apart baby, don't fall apart, passion)

Passionate from miles away (Passionate from mile away)
Passive with the things you say (Things I say)
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no (Please don't blame me now)
Passionate from miles away (Passionate from mile away)
Passive with the things you say (Things I say)
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no (Please don't blame me now)

Passionate from miles away
Passionate from miles
Passionate from miles away
Passionate from miles
I know you need me
I know you need me
You know I need you
You know I need you too
