Ayy, ayy
Lot of 6's in here tonight
Yeah, yeah
Ayy

Ten of us, we moving as one
I'm so proud of who I've become
You might think I've taken some lumps
Only if we talking 'bout sums, yeah
Intentions are pure, they cannot tell me relax
My mentions are jokes, but they never give me the facts
This isn't that, can't be ignoring the stats
Based off of that, they gotta run me the Max
They gotta run me the Max, they gotta double the racks
They had it set up for real but they didn't come with the slaps
When I heard the shit I was skipping through that
If I get it trippin', it's no coming back
I don't understand, these niggas gotta adapt
You know where I'm at, I put the six on the map
Your shorty was bent, she wanted to vent, I promise it fell in my lap
My money is young, my problems are old, I promise I'm bridging the gap

You know what I'm sayin'
Ayy, ayy
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'
(Gyeah, gyeah, gyeah, gyeah)

Niggas provoke, this shit ain't a joke, man, nobody playing
He's at the top and he's at the top, but nobody staying
These niggas around but they ain't around, you know what I'm sayin'?
Say that they down, when they shit is down, you know what I'm sayin'?

Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'
Ayy, ayy
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'

Yo, get close enough to HOV smell like a kilo still
First album 26, I ain't need no deal
Already a hood legend, I ain't need no shine
First Rollie flooded out, I ain't see no time, woah
Stand up niggas, we only ducking indictments
Dope boys, off-white, looking like soft white on 'em
You know what I'm saying?
We in the building, we came for a billion, ain't nobody playing
Live every word that I'm rapping, say I lost ninety two bricks and it happened
You probably wouldn't believe everything that you seeing right now if it wasn't live action
I ain't on the 'Gram, they record who I am
God to these dope boys, how do you not be a HOV fan?
I'm what Meech should have been, I'm what Supreme didn't become
If Alpo didn't snitch, niggas'd be like Young
I got your President tweeting, I won't even meet with him
Y'all killed X, let Zimmerman live, s-s-streets is done

You know what I'm sayin'
Ayy, ayy
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'
