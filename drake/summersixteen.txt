Look, looking, looking
Looking, looking, looking
Looking, looking
Looking
Looking

Looking for revenge
All summer sixteen
All summer sixteen
Playing dirty, not clean
Out front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
All in the same thing
All repping one thing
Looking for revenge

To do what you couldn't do
Tell Obama that my verses
Are just like the whips that he in
They bulletproof
Minus twenty we in Pitfield
That Kai's kitchen in a Canada Goose
Famous as fuck but I'm still in the cut
When they round up the troops
I'm just a sicko, a real sicko
When you get to know me, nigga
I let the diss record drop
You was staying right below me, nigga
We must have played it a hundred times
You was going to bed
Why would I put on a vest?
I expect you to aim for the head?
I coulda killed you the first time
You don't have to try and say it louder nigga
Trust, we heard you the first time
It's nothing personal
I would have done it to anyone
And I blame where I came from
And I blame all my day ones
You know Chubbs like Draymond
You better off not saying nothing
Them boys they a handful
Then I hit 'em with the Hotline
Chris Breezy with the dance moves
Mo-G with the dance moves
Ave Boy with the dance moves
Jimi Hendrix with the solo
Those the strings that you can't pull
Yeah, and I could really dish it out
Come and get it from the source
Or fuck with all the word of mouth
Golden State running practice at my house
Nigga, what am I about?
You gon' really feel it now

I'm out here looking for revenge
All summer sixteen
All summer sixteen
Playing dirty, not clean
Out front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
All repping one thing
Looking for revenge

All you boys in the new Toronto
Wanna be me a little
All your exes know I like my O's
With a V in the middle
You would love it if I went away
And didn't say nothing else
How am I keeping it real
By keeping this shit to myself?
You was never gang, gang, gang, gang
You was never one of us
Had us fooled for a minute there
Now we done all grown up
But I'm better off anyway
Y'all never gonna finish Drake
Say you seeing 'bout it when you see me man
Y'all never home anyway
Thought of things that you shoulda say
Said things that you shouldn't say
We even gave y'all the whole money play
Y'all broke to this day
"Oh, it's your time now" yeah
That's what everybody say
I used to wanna be on Roc-A-Fella
Then I turned into Jay
Now I got a house in LA
Now I got a bigger pool than Ye
And look man, Ye's pool is nice
Mine's just bigger is what I'm saying
I'm that nigga's what I'm saying
Getting things done around here
How you let me run it down here
I'm not even from around here
Six, six, six, six, six
Soon as I'm back in the city they throw a parade
I might get a key to the city and give it to Wayne
Or give it to one of the young boys to carry the wave
Yeah

So trust me they'll be out here looking for revenge
All summer sixteen
All summer sixteen
Playing dirty, not clean
Out front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
All repping one thing
Looking for re

They don't want us to have a bigger pool than Kanye
