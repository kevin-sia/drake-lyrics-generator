Yo what's goin on, this is Drake
And I'ma let you know what you about to witness aight?
This right here, is a Drake, and DJ Smallz collaboration
So I'm from Canada, my mans from down South
You understand the #1 DJ in the South to be exact
You heard that at the VMA's, you heard it wherever he goes
My man Smallz is out there down South
Same time reppin for Toronto, Canada y'knahmean?
So this right here what you 'bout what you listenin to right NOW
is the official, "Southern Smoke: Special Edition"
I call it the "Room For Improvement" mixtape
Cause I'm not perfect, and I bet neither are you if you listenin
so you need to just accept, what's THERE, y'knahmean? But look
You need to just let this play out
from track one, to track whatever however many I put on here
You need to just listen to this because look man
it's the first time, Canadian, down South, my man Smallz
Your boy Drake, you know what it is man
So just, uhh, tune in nigga...


Southern Smoke!!!

Yeah. Ho! 
It's Drake. Uh Uh. Ho!
Do that dance. Do that Dance

You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

Look I ought to be thankful because for women I have plenty of love
And when it comes to relationships, many is stuck
Look at 50 you make love, 30 you have sex
Somewhere around the tender age of 20 you fuck
Or maybe before, I'm here waiting to score
It's long gone like brother's having a tape in their car
Instead these girls taking it raw,
Now they tell you to do whatever you want because it's safe to explore
Forget, wait till it's right now, wait till it's more 
Wait till he get gets a deal girl, wait till the tour
So they dance to attract me, advance and attack me
To the point that Drake compare me to Anthony Mackie
But once they have my pants and my khakis
I tell them I'm not one for commitment and romancing exactly
Because, I hate waking up undressed with a dame
And guessing her name, I hope this shit is destined to change

Because you special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

I don't get it, it's like my fairy was sick
It's like I meet the perfect girl, and she put me through some various shit
It's something that I can rarely predict
All I know is that I can never find the love that Tyler Perry depict
I'm guessing maybe Shemar Moore isn't really all pure
Maybe I lie to myself and it's like a small cure
I tell it all to her
I gotta feeling this feeling inside is something it's like and can't be all sure
Because really, What is a window without a car door?
Why I can't settle for one instead of all four?
Mu mind is clouded, this shit complex here
Jason tell me I'ma have a baby by next year
Psychic told me I'ma have three kids
I don't want my daughter making a song like Teairra Mari did
So, I'ma change yeah this summer is gone
I'm running along, before I raise one of my own

Because you special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

Believe me baby, Stevie baby
D-R-A-K-Eezzy baby
So do that dance, do that dance,
Go head girl and do that dance, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. Uh

Yeah because you special baby
Yeah this the remix right here
Yeah Trendsetters
Drake, It's Southern Smoke


Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

Getting down tonight if they say you cuttin'
A lot of dudes in my city, they ain't saying nothin'
A lot of records from here, they get no play
And these labels don't give advances so you get no pay
Them little rims on the ride, Imma let those stay
So these nosy niggas don't know that I get checks all day
'Whats he worth?' Fans keep trying to guess it
My record ain't even finish, they keep trying to press it
Boi-1da and Drake if it's beef I address it
And the black Phantom is here soon as Visalia exit
Both of the deals, nothin' under a mill
We know you got it to give and we trying to collect it
Long as I got me some heat through the winter
Drake known as a pro, I'ma teach you beginners
'Bout to ink with a major like sheets through a printer
For features, y'all better get me while it's cheaper than dinner
'Cause me and 1da trying to get at your girl
If you see her tell this nigga got some beats Imma send her

Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

Check, the verses I'm writin', you might wanna learn it
You hatin' my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake, might wanna return it
'Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl
She'll forget you and I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is, you just notice me now
But I was here along, your vision's just been distorted
I'm so throwed, wilin' in this, you ask me what the business is
And I'll write a sixteen and record it
The waiting is over I think music needed
Drake cuttin' his records without gettin' weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed
I got this dude they expectations I'ma exceed it
Like a single with only backgrounds
Y'all record and when it's done, ya lyrics tend to mislead shit
Finally here I'ma star with the timin'
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclinin'
This for anybody that's searchin' for cash
And purchasin' fast, you only get the dough when you grindin'
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhymin', boy

Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

Two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to kick some new school lines
And so I sent him a rhyme, it was fresh to death
Now not signing me is somethin' that the rest regret
Then I, hopped inside the Cadillac
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back

Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do


Southern Smoke {echo}
It's Southern Smoke baby!
(Money) Frank 
(Money) My man Nickelus F
(Money) Ho! It's Drake. Southern Smoke
(Money) This is the remix right here
(Money) So if you got some (Money)
Put ya hands in the air
(Money) Southern Smoke

Now-a-days you sayin' that I should go Jermaine, I should go Pharrell
Either or my nigga, make sure you don't get shelled
(Right) Make sure your money's right and they do a promotion well
So you could get checks cut like Benedict in Ocean's Twelve
This ain't Brad Pitt, I gotta admit
I'm sick of seeing chicks in that Louis V and that Plaid shit, cause it's a bad fit
They say my father lives through me, so this is just basically how my dad spit
I know my cash come quick when it's sunny
You know a girl is special if I stick with her honey
If it wasn't for dummies chick would still have money
And if it wasn't for money Nick would still have Skummy
So, guess it's kinda like a gift and a curse
To jip money is easier than liftin' a purse
If you pick the wrong mother who'll snatch you, run for cover
A week later you might find ya click in a hearse, boy!

I, take time arrange that (Money)
Some, kill just to claim that (Money)
Switch countries exchange that (Money)
You cannot get jack for freeee

And my, proceeds and cash right (Money)
There's, no need to stash right (Money)
Got the same, 4 g's from last night (Money)
You cannot take that from meeeee, homie

You cannot take that from meeeee, homie


Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings
Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings
Head to works, I get some breakfast 'cause, still a nigga yawning
From the night before, at the club I was up I'm tryna live
Only twenty two my nig, 'bout to be twenty three ya dig?

Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings
Head to works, I get some breakfast 'cause, still a nigga yawning
From the night before, at the club I was up I'm tryna live
Only twenty two my nig, 'bout to be twenty three ya dig?
Time don't wait for none of us that's why I gotta chase my dreams
Make my momma proud so she can show off all her pearly teeth
And be half the man my dad was, I thank God he was in my life
I realize how many 
Either I, need to make this music work or move from the Earth
I'm preachin' fire, need a choir, 'bout to take you all to church
My congregation bombed the nation with this HIP HOP
We in the race to fame, blowin' pass the PIT STOPS
I heard the prize was some chicks and a WRIST WATCH
And all you gotta do is go to jail or GET SHOT
Yeah Nick cop but he ain't never get popped
How we gonna get pop fans? Give 'em a quick shot
Now I get ya chick hot with my wrist watch
Yeah shorty drip drop when it tick tock
It's kinda sick huh? Ay Jay, put it in the heart of Pickering
And tell them niggas this is NICK'S SPOT
They don't keep it fresh enough I got it zip locked
Saran wrap, anthrax, it make ya sick huh
I'm hot as fire wanna put me out with piss huh

It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM

I'm tryna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em hos
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM

Ayo I stay up every evening, write that shit that they believe in
DJs run it, they approach me, and it's praise I be receiving
From the night befo', at the club, fake I.D. my record spins
Got me dancin' right outside since these niggas won't let me in
Well guess again, slip around the back and get it crackin'
And all the bottles wrapped in cellophane 
Hundred grand, Nickle F, that nigga's the next to win
Virgina go rep for him, and Memphis represent for me
To the tenth 10 degree, Tennekey, T Dot to the country ya'll
Orangemen and White Haven, an back up north to Montreal
I ain't ashamed, my city ain't on the map
 Light that fire, realize they ain't born to rap

Maybe they can bring they career back
But these niggas right here ain't tryna hear that
Cause I'm on set, make it work, break even on 9 to 5's
Cigarettes and lotto tickets, tryna keep that grind alive
All my uncles, they hit the casino when they get they check
My cousins, they paint they  to get respect
This can't be life, dominoes and  dro and twenty stacks

Rest In Peace to SKUMMY this reality not funny rap!
You think it's funny till these youngings suck a bunny
Pull the jack rabbit out and get to screamin' where the money at?!

It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM

I'm tryna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em hos
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM


This the record that my backpack underground fans get to get to skippin
Back back, Southern town fans get to tippin
Chasin fat stacks, runnin down grands and submission
I don't back track, every single sound for me different
I don't own no ice, just got clean rap
Don't ever two step, I just rock, lean, snap
We could take it out to Houston where the rides all glossed up
Anybody I'm standin beside's all bossed up
Burgular ? they say I'm servin them rhymers
And me and Nickel F go together like burgers and diners, yes
I'm like a waiter and you something like a hater
With trays in both hands, place an order I can cater uh
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my *chopped voice* speech slow
Peep though, I only got pity for you lames
Sitting pretty in the game, in the city that I claim


Yo, the city is mine (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna 
Shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!


Break it down like you working for your tuition at Howard
Mama, get it how you live, that thang that you working is power
Tryna be generous, so honey here's a tip
Now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip
So if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip
And if you find 'em attractive and funny, that's when you dip, dip
And it's a trip, my city broke into sections
Up North I got me a couple of troubles, couple connections
And it's nothing that I created on purpose, there's people that gotta problem
But they scared to let it surface, uh
Ya boy say this, that, and the third to 'em
See me out and they never utter a word to 'em
Expect me not to draw a card from the deck
Anybody in my city going hard I respect but,
You gotta debt and you choose not to pay that
Imma hop ya fence, come into your yard and collect, lect uh
It ain't a problem of concern bruh, I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh
This ain't last year, money like a cashier, so hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
Yessir, I live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine, shine
And, I be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line, line
And I got way too much love, for the city I can never get too much of
And if anybody hatin on me, I deport 'em, the city is mine boy


Yo, the city is mine (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna 
Shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!

Break it down, break it break it down
Break it down, break it break it down
Break it down, break it break it down
Break it down, break it break it down
Break it down

He Can Come Pick You Up
If Your Dads In The Hood

Robbing R&B Singers, 'specially If They Know Where The Keys At

A Lot Of People Only Play They Part When They Spittin
But I Dont Think That They Understood

Or Maybe To Think On
So Next Time You Out At The Club
And A Brother Offers The Whole Table Something To Drink On
You Just Take In Effect He Got A Stack With A Mink On
Now He Got You Doing Everything That You Think Wrong
Look, You Tell Your Parents That Its Cash At An Easy Pace
Ya Dad Screaming Take Ya Ass Outta Jeezy Face
And As Ya Man I Wont Back Down First
But They Got You Doing Soft-Core Background Work
That Messed Up Like An Officer That Pulls You Over
And He Ask Questions Later And Pat Down First
But You Aint Thandie Newton, And This Aint Crash Here
The Resolutions Passed Baby, This Aint Last Year
Look, I Got A Message, I'll Say It
I Got Some Beats Still
Regina Hall And Garcelle And Alice Neal
Young Girls These Here Women With Big Dreams
Role Models That You Can Watch On The Big Screen
If You Refuse To Change And You That Chick Still
Respect Yourself, Dont Be Convinced That These Tricks Will
You Got An Audience Believe It Or Not
My Cousin Who Cant Speak Know The Lyrics To Tip Drill

Video Girl
Eh Yo You Have To Listen
Im In A Bad Position
I Fell In Love With A
Video Girl
I Wouldnt Call Her Name
I Got The Feelin That They All The Same
And She A
Video Girl
To The Fullest Extent
So I Wrote You A Song
Cuz I Cant Stay With A
Video Girl
And You Betrayed Your Wealth
Got A Feelin You Shoulda Stayed Yourself

And I Aint Trying Ta Generalize Every Video Girl, You N'a Mean?
Say That Ya All One Way Man Its Just That Sometimes Man You Gotta
Accept The Fact That Theres Times That You Gotta Better Yourself
You Know As A Person Man. I Love To See My Black Women Strong, Single,
Independent. Doing They Thing Without Popping They Booty In Some Rappers
Video You N'a Mean? Its A Wonderful Thing Baby. So Uh, Dont Hate Me For
This One Ladies. Just Take My Advice You N'a Mean? Cuz Its Like Uh,
If She Beautiful And Honey Dances
And You Always Downtown Making Money Transfers
And Anything The Color Of Braces She Get Excited
She Always Showing Up At These Places She Get Invited
She A Video Girl


Yeah, This Dedicated To Canada Man
The Whole Up North
A Lot Of People Don't Realize How Cold It Gets During The Winter
But Listen...

I Met This New Girl Late June Or Early July
I Called Her A Bunch Of Times But She Barely Replied
Now It's December, I'm Driving, And She's Like Where's My Hi?
I Swear, That I Never Called You Cause I Really Get Shy
See That Was A Segue, I Believe The Matter
Is What Happens After The Seaon Where The Leaves Just Scatter
Where The Timb Laces Get Tighter And Parka Hoods Flip Up
Drugs Dealers Standin And They Parka Hoods Slip Up
Where Girls Become Exes From Summer's Caught Ho'in
The Winter Cars Come Out, The Summer Cars Go In
And Some Places Is Breezy, And Some It Start Snow-Ing
And If You Planning Family Vacations You Better Know When
But Some Mothers Scared To Send They Daughters Out The City
Instead She Get A Sweater That She Bought Her Out Of Pity
Cause Mom Stays Up Late, She Seen Them Videos
Where Cancun College Students Pouring Water On Their Titties!

Yeah Man, It's A Funny Thing Going Through The Winter Up Here Man
A Lot Of Girls Y'know, Wanna Get Close. You Might Think They The One
But Just Wait, Nah Mean, Take It Slow

Forget To Mention, This Girl That Never Gets To The Beach
She Lives Just West Of My Street, And So We Destined To Meet
Since I'm Driving, I Ask Her How To Get The Suite
She Doesn't Answer, Opens The Door And Just Gets In The Seat
She Throws Her Bag In The Back, And Starts Adjusting The Heat
She's Bold But I Roll With It, I'm Impressed Cause She's Sweet
Then She Says "I Heard Your Song And I'm Obsessed With The Beat,
I Mean, The Lyrics Are Good, But I'm Obsessed With The Beat
I Love It When Voyce Sings And The Chorus Is Good,
There's A Couple Things In The Song That I Suggest You Repeat"
Off This I'm Kinda Takin It Back For A Second,
I Get Her Number She Tells Me To Call Her After This Session
And So I Do, And It's Kind Of Awkward, The Surface Hard To Scratch
Until We End Up Sexin And Now My Heart Attached
I'm Thinkin Off I Should've Been More Southern
And Realizing All That She Wanted Was That Indoor Lovin And Ho!

Yeah, Uh, I Told Ya'll I Had A Story For You Right
Uh, Ya Man, It's What It Is

And Now, I'm Proud To Have Her Like Montreal To The Frizzench
She Love To Play Hurt Like Carter Did On The Bizzench
But, My Boy Say I'm Actin Different, Because I Lay Downtown
And I Still I Rush To Pick Her Up From Work And Fizzench
She Tellin Everyone Imma Hold Here Down
Tell Everyone I'm The Prince Up In This Cold Clear Town
And Stupid Me I Just Listen To Her,
Instead Of Wondering If This Is Really Gon' Last Me The Whole Year Round
But Then Spring Shows Up, And It's Dallas In This Bitch
The Weather Starts To Resemble The Holidays She Missed
When We Were Together It Seeming Like Way Back When
Ball Players Hop On The Plane And Make It Way Back In
See She Used To Play Piana, And Now She Never Wait For Santa
Instead Of Saving For Marriage, She Saving For Carrabanna
And It's A Shame, She Had Me Convinced That She Could've Been A Dime
I Guess, I Lost Another One To The Wintertime

I Miss You, Most Of Aaaallll, Myy Daarling 
(Gimme A Second To Gather My Toughts)
 Strolling In The Park (Ho!)
And Watching Winter Turn To Spriing (Such A Beautiful Day Man)
(Yeah Man, You Know We Had To Switch It On 'em Right?)
Strolling In The Park, And Watching Winter Turn To Spriing
(I'm Still Standing On Two Feet, Even After This Tragic Loss)
(Man, But I Got Something To Else To Tell Ya Baby)

I Remember Them Encore Pms, Breakfast And The Wake Up
Now Drake's Committed We Waiting On The Breakup
So We Can Get Back To Them Cognac Nights
With Dress Codes And Light Skinned Girls That Won't Act Right
And I Laugh Cause My Previous Lifestyle Was Quite Wild
The Winter Came And Blew His Cold Air Through
Back Then Light Sweaters And A Couple Drinks Might Get Her,
By The End Of The Week I Would Know That Crew
And We'd Assembled A Trio, A Whole New Scene
With Three Ladies In The Shot We Never Broke Routine
At The End Of Every Cut When The Cameras Are Rollin
We Had Ladie's Hearts Always Gettin Damaged And Stolen
But This Summer Is Different It's A Two Man Operation
Granted The Fact That We One Man Short
Got Love For Him He Can Watch This New Man Stop A Nation
Cause Handin' Them Crack Is A One Man Sport
Instead Of Dress-Up, I Walk In Sweat Pants And Chomp Clinkin'
I Find A Girl We Step Dance And Calm Drinkin'
The Face, The Breast, The Bras, The Toes
I'm Still Solo And A Long Night Draws To A Close
Cause It's A Fact, If She Come To The Crib And I Get Some Ass Inside
We'll Never Talk Again, Scary And True
That Song Special I Recorded With Voyce Well It's Like A Classified
It's What I'm Lookin For To Carry Me Through
Yet I Can't Seem To Find A Heavy Girl That Possesses It
Only Wants A Friendship Causing Me To Forget The Shit
And When They Talk About They Past And Lovers
And You Get Mad At The Though Of It Giving Ass To Others
Yet You Find Peace With Yourself, Now Least There's Some Room To Ride
There's Also Room For Improvement As Soon As June Arrive

Strolling In The Park, And Watching Winter Turn To Spriing
Strolling In The Park, And Watching Winter Turn To Spriing
Strolling In The Park, And Watching Winter Turn To Spriing


Southern Smoke!!!

Yeah. Ho! 
It's Drake. Uh Uh. Ho!
Do that dance. Do that Dance

You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

Look I ought to be thankful because for women I have plenty of love
And when it comes to relationships, many is stuck
Look at 50 you make love, 30 you have sex
Somewhere around the tender age of 20 you fuck
Or maybe before, I'm here waiting to score
It's long gone like brother's having a tape in their car
Instead these girls taking it raw,
Now they tell you to do whatever you want because it's safe to explore
Forget, wait till it's right now, wait till it's more 
Wait till he get gets a deal girl, wait till the tour
So they dance to attract me, advance and attack me
To the point that Drake compare me to Anthony Mackie
But once they have my pants and my khakis
I tell them I'm not one for commitment and romancing exactly
Because, I hate waking up undressed with a dame
And guessing her name, I hope this shit is destined to change

Because you special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

I don't get it, it's like my fairy was sick
It's like I meet the perfect girl, and she put me through some various shit
It's something that I can rarely predict
All I know is that I can never find the love that Tyler Perry depict
I'm guessing maybe Shemar Moore isn't really all pure
Maybe I lie to myself and it's like a small cure
I tell it all to her
I gotta feeling this feeling inside is something it's like and can't be all sure
Because really, What is a window without a car door?
Why I can't settle for one instead of all four?
Mu mind is clouded, this shit complex here
Jason tell me I'ma have a baby by next year
Psychic told me I'ma have three kids
I don't want my daughter making a song like Teairra Mari did
So, I'ma change yeah this summer is gone
I'm running along, before I raise one of my own

Because you special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

Believe me baby, Stevie baby
D-R-A-K-Eezzy baby
So do that dance, do that dance,
Go head girl and do that dance, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. Uh

Yeah because you special baby
Yeah this the remix right here
Yeah Trendsetters
Drake, It's Southern Smoke


It's Southern Smoke Boy !
Ho, Yeah, Uh huh
It's Trey Songz and uh, D-R-A-K-K-E

this knowledge if you aint got it you could catch it later
my money then lovers seperate for I commit the date up
i put a split in the middle then i seperater

It aint about the rims on my truck
Aint about the ice on my watch
Aint about teh coop of my truck
Baby its about the Game

Ridin' low
Layed back in the seat when I creep
That's just how I roll
With some fresh nice ones on my feet
That's it goes
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't about the dough
Cause it ain't all about that no more

It aint about the rims on my truck
Aint about the ice on my watch
Aint about teh coop of my truck
Baby its about the Game

It aint about the shoes that I've got
Aint about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop
Baby it's about the game

When you ask why I'm hustlin' in the streets that's just who I be
Yo, I live for the dough, for the flow, for feelin' free
Ain't too many other dudes you can choose to get this luxury
But without it all I'm still about the game

The haters wanna hate, but it ain't nothing
Because the ladies choose to love me (they love me for what I do)

It aint about the rims on my truck
Aint about the ice on my watch
Aint about teh coop of my truck
Baby its about the Game

It aint about the shoes that I've got
Aint about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop
Baby it's about the game

Southern Smoke!!!

This another one from your boy V-O
I'm gon tell the people, that we locking this down
This another one from your boy V-O
I'm gon tell the people, that we locking this down

I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, All this Love (loving me)!!
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know
I can't contain myself, All this Love (loving me)!!

Girl, I've been thinking about the way, that you love me every day
And I want to know, if You Feel The Same Way!!
Because I'm in and out of town, that's just how I got's to get down
But you understand, that's why I'm your man!!

I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, All this Love (loving me)!!
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know
I can't contain myself, All this Love (loving me)!!

YEAH YEAH (Keep rocking to this beat)
UH, UH, UH (You want me to drop to this beat?)
UH, UH, UH (HO!)
YEAH YEAH (Let me get a little gospel on them. Yeah. Uh)

They say he wanted the bounce back
I can make them easily admit that the bounce back
Without knowing exactly where me accounts at
Yeah, you best believe
That I often tend to surpass what the rest achieve
So, they don't like me
They throw parties, and yet they never invite me
I can't lie, sometime it bother me slightly
Either way the true fans yell
I appear calm, and it's obvious of who can't tell
And no, this ain't Blu Cantrell
This is like perfection, though we both got the light complexion
Couple things I do damn well,
And the way that I Jack son, you figure Drake knew Sam. L (Samuel Jackson)
I'm for real though
I'm from Memphis, I'm often labeled as Trill so
They stay kicking it with me like a field goal
See I'm humble, but I live fame
For more deals on the table than abridge game. Ahh

I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, All this Love (loving me)!!
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know
I can't explain myself, All this Love (loving me)!!

Even when the sun don't shine, I know you're my sunshine
And even if the sun outside, we can anything baby
I need to feel you next to me, You want to feel me next to you
We can do anything you want to do
Tell Me the Next Morn Baby!!!

I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, All this Love (loving me)!!
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know
I can't contain myself, All this Love (loving me)!!


Niggas in the city hatin' me man they trippin'
When I'm the only one that's really spittin'
My nigga Lil Lee the only one that's really grippin'
Why you deck(?) me up actin' like like we cool if you don't feel him nigga?

Uh, I'm bringing back hip hop
Me and my nigga Drake
VA, Toronto, Hip-Hop

 
Aiight let me take my jacket off
Unlace the timbs, here again comes the jabberjaw
This time I'm blabbin on 
These rappers that feel a certain way but they get me yappin off
Mad cuz the freestyle iller than they whole catalog
I got the gift like Santa Claus
Flow got spring like a catapult
Matter fact the flow Supreme like Diana Ross
I'm at the do' like a deer with the antlers off
Niggas acting like Scummy was they neega(?)
Wouldn't even give my man a 12 bar feature
I know who you are cause he wanted me to eat ya
I said nah lets keep it peaceful
My nigga was a true weed source
He gave it to us for a cheap cost, for prices we all could eat off
A real street dog
The type of nigga that y'all niggas be studying learning how to get street off
We have an impostor, alert the doctor
Bout to hit him up with the chopper like Blaka
Shock em like Blanca from Street Fighter, heat got a
Hurricane kick, murder everything quick
Look, my new Ryu nine is stupendous
Why do guys choose my crew to pick wit
My crew lie you guys into ditches
I said it and meant it the Scorpio's Mind has many dimensions
I'll say it in intent, sentence, indent, on instant pimpin
Hope your listenin to my diction
If you are then you now should be itchin
That its crack we placed in your stereo system
Yea, I be at your burial trippin
Nickelus F from Richmond
VA, 
The Scorpio's Mind is not a game to play wit all day

I've been hated by many, wanted by plenty
Disliked by some, but confronted by none
Since they don't show me sincerity, I load up, lock up
Take shots at em I guess you could call it a parody
But compared to D
They one-fourth from watermelon to a quarter felon, dude you a pear to me
If that's not how it is it ain't how it appear to be
You got blind heaters, in my sweats is a mind reader
And when the psychic get to touchin my palm
Seein your physical, the things that you never say to me visible
Especially when one of your artist feelin threatened
Cause I'm harnessin a weapon, won't you pardon my reflection
Mirror, mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage
To play around, to perfection I'm the spittin image
My verbal camp is vivid, I told you I'm spittin image
It seems we often want to start but never get to finish
My verbal campus is Villanova, and those of you feelin Hova
And writing college rhymes, but the thrill is over
Let me assist you like a specialist
So you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this
It's not a problem wit X, I guess I'm a pessimist
Which means if shit goes bad, I say "I expected this"
And me and Julien we never got the chance to communicate
Instead of understanding its a tune of hate
The city's mine like Oklahoma's a Sooner state
And we're gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late
So, why don't you walk up in the spot using less strut
You aint Morris Chestnut, you lighter and less cut
And lets be honest, by now you should be your own scholar
You still a protege, that's the reason I don't holler
You got rappers being repetitive actors
You stay ahead of the game, I'm ahead of the practice boi


Southern Smoke!!!

Yeah. Ren. M.O.F. Haha. 
It's Drake man. It's Drake man.Yeah
Ayo Ren this that gritty shit here man
I'ma half to tell them about I been through on this know what I mean
HO!  Southern Smoke!!!

Very few give you that truth, it's either they can't do it with lyrics
Or can't do it in spirit, they cancel what they doing
The samples that they using, can't get through the clearing
I'll handle it since they just can't get you to hear it
My father's early careering forced my parents to split up
My mother was a teacher, my father was kind of fed up
With just being a florist, the choir sang his chorus
And he got back into doing what he was doing before us
Because money is an issue, your son he gon miss you
And plus you got a wife at home because mommy still exist too
Now you looking for exes, you ain't never expect this
You end up doing time, and me I end up with a step-sis
Nobody passing judgment, or question where the drugs went
You know I hold you down because without you, I'd be a wasn't
And mommy I'ma support her, I keep it all in order
See her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border 
But

I got stress on my shoulders
Trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder
Young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
And you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
IT'S STRESS MY NIGGA!!!
I'm just trying to live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
to make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!
I'm just trying to live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
to make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!

This is my life, and so the rest is kinda been cool, question what I been through
I write a verse addressing it, and yes I might offend you
Picture when I was in school,
Me being the closest thing to black, and guess what rap music what I was into
Rest of the kids were sheltered, I never liked to fight
But when someone called me a "nigger" I'd punch them I couldn't help it
Now I'm grown I can say what it is
It's parents that got these Black and Filipino nannies raising they kids
And your daddy want it very right
I make you happy, plus I'm Jewish, he don't approve, I think he want you to marry white
He want Sinatra at the wedding, not Barry White
Because black is black honey, even if he's very light
And so I never been for dinner at they places
Always brutally honest, and so I pin it to they faces
I live it so the case is, whether Drake is
Way ahead of his time, or inquisitive and racist

I got stress on my shoulders
Trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder
Young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
And you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
IT'S STRESS MY NIGGA!!!
I'm just trying to live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny to make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!
I'm just trying to live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny to make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!

Am I hot as the rest, should I strive for my spot as the best
Like girls with Double D's, I gotta lot on my chest
There's questions that need to be answered that's not on the test
Instead of staring at quizzes (?) now it's models with breasts
And yes, when I'm dismissed after a tedious listen
I sit at home and say I should of been a pediatrician 
Homie, I probably could of been on TV consistent
An artist like Pablo, or maybe Petey's assistant 
And my mindset is come and get me
I'm all alone at home with my mom and grandma and ain't nobody running with me
So, if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady, daughter, and her grandson
Nigga get the handgun
If not, you gon make me call the burbs out in Richmond
That have you niggas laying out on the curb, they some hitmen
Last couple of months I done probably been
Around the world and back, and I don't wanna question half the places Nick been

I got stress on my shoulders (Uh!)
Trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder (Yeah!)
Young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older (Oh!)
And you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers (Yeah man!)
IT'S STRESS MY NIGGA!!!
I'm just trying to live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
to make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO! (This that gritty shit boy)
I'm just trying to live my life cuz (Got me winded over here man)
Make a little money, find a bunny
to make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO! (Uh)


Sometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff are the only ones with enough
To feel what I'm about to say in this song
When they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself
And you do it and get the feeling it's wrong
That there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping
And they try to make you out as a lie
Symbolic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason
It's a lose lose why even try
When your ideas so frequently get rejected, people just get neglected
And they never really know how to feel
Phone calls is something that you're expecting for someone without the ethics 
And the motives to try and make them a mill
You never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and
Niggas wanna say that you ain't around
I mean there's always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming
that you couldn't help and maybe next time you ain't in town

You gonna try to try harder cuz
Try harder cuz
Try Try-Try-Try

And the managers make you succumb to pressure and you spitting' is fresher 
than most of these rappers running the game
Concerned that people who copy what's in the past and turn the profit with cash
There's time I would have done it the same
I mean I got me a range, Also got me a guilty conscience
That made you tell anybody I meet that I rent
Sometimes I wish that I would just chilled on the sneakers
and watched the game from the bleachers
Because I'm really tend to need what I spent
In a house that I promised to get my mother don't compensate for the other time
I wasted late out at the club
Instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner I'm working hard on the winner 
so this album is a labor of love
You say as long as I'm staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats 
That she can rest without a toss and a turn
Because she know that my reputation perceives me and people watch me on TV
That's exactly why I often get burned
But I'm gonna try to..

You gonna try to try harder cuz
Try harder cuz
Try Try-Try-Try


Uh, what up y'all!
Soundtrack what's popping baby?
Y'all ain't know, I go by the name of Lupe Fiasco
Representing that first and fifteen
Jyea, uh!
And this one right here
I dedicate this one right here
To all my homies out there grinding
You know what I'm saying?
Legally and illegally
Hahaha...
You know what I'm talking about?
So, check it out

First got it when he was six
Didn't know any tricks
Matter of fact first time he got on it he slipped
Landed on his hip
And bust his lip
For a week he had to talk with a lisp
Like THISSSSS
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didn't quit there was something in the air
Yea, he said it was something so appealing
He couldn't fight the feeling
Something about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it
Couldn't understand it
Brand it, just the first kickflip he land it
Uh, labeled a misfit, a bandit
Kakunk Kakunk Kakunk!
His neighbors couldn't stand it so
He was banished to the park
Started in the morning wouldn't stop 'til after dark
Yea, when they said, "It's getting late in here..
...so I'm sorry young man there's no skating here"

And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel
Looking for a place to be
So let's kick... and push... and coast

(Waddup Lupe, Chi Town!)
My style is very Tennessee
mixed with some Terry Kennedy
people barley remember me from back in the day
i done got some contacts and threw the glasses away
the time it took me to get cool was a massive delay
but check it gets boring growing up in memphis
trying to become a pro but keep showing up apprentice
mama probably would have done anything to prevent this
cause every single time i break a board it gets expensive
luckly my aunt working as a nurse
so every time i needed something she just reach up in her purse
and plus she'd always give me speeches on the first
if i 'm staying in her house then i need to get some work
i tell her i was there on vacation
she say you need to be doing something other than skating
why don't you go kick it with your uncle in the basement
i ma let him know that your coming honey he's waiting
so now its me and old school
chekka playa playing chess looking through old school wrek a airs
he knew i didn't really wanna post here
open up the window told me that the coast clear
now i coast clear take a deep breath feeling like the popes here
Homie this is Recess east test
life's ever given me a plus graded by a teacher in a sweet dress
yes i'm literly Landel Lewis with a kick and a snare
kick flip in the air
the kids sick till them jeans put a rip in the pair
just so the space ain't restricted in here
breathe again think its obvious that they need my soul
Cousins at the door like ri mi fa so
i say aunty this is a safe career
she said Drake i told you there's no skating here

And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel
Looking for a place to be
So let's kick... and push... and coast

Before he knew he had a crew
That wasn't no punk
And they spitfire shirts
And SB dunks
They would push 'til they couldn't skate no more
Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing they said
Any escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy
They needed to break out
They head to any place with stairs
Any good grinds
The world was theirs
Uh, and their four wheels would take them there
Until the cops came and said, "There's no skating here"

And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel
Looking for a place to be
So let's kick... and push... and coast


SHAKE UP THE WORLD

Sit back and admire the talent that I possess
Top notch, no less
Oh yes
I'm known in the city, but need to bust out like a model to show chest
Cause you deal with agents from check collections
I'm keepin it clean in a little X direction
And babygirl if you don't like me it's probably due to the fact that you are last like next selection
The city is mine, I control this

I promise
Yeah


Shout out to 40-40
Yeah my right hand!


I got ice all over my windshield
I can tell it's gon' be a cold winter
I hit the defrost 
I never turn the heat off
And still I'm so chilli willy snowflake
These silly billies really feel to act as if they know Drake
Always gossipin' callin' and textin'
Magneto niggas tryna bring down ex-men/ X-men
Tellin' my ex-girl tryna ex-plain
How I am no good so go with the next man
But dog
You don't know me 
You don't know us
We go by the name of A-T-F
And any previous affiliation
They know to hold they tongue and I spare 'em humiliation
I know you in and out 
Nigga I am not playin'
Just fall back keep on Escape'in and Alize'in
And stop tryna act like you like me and my team
Not us so you knock us
That's precisely what I mean
And dog 
It's forever clear
My money evergreen
My presence required in places you have never been
It's all in a day's work that's what I am on
NBC, MTV, Viacom
And who's Continental GT is outside
Showin' them how monumental he be?
One wheel one the curb 
Ticket on the dash
It's like e'ry fuckin' summer I just switch it on they ass
And maaan I'm a commodity
None of them as hot as me
The industry standard 
So I am what they gotta be
'Cause Drake's syllables is like Jake Gyllenhaal
Can't help it
I been brainwashed to kill 'em all
I think I should pass my own amendment
You frontin' with glass all in your pen-dant
You ain't livin' rapper you never have been
You a has-been a gas station attendant
Your man is a turkey you wit' a liar
I'm clearin' the air I'm a humidifier
I'm spittin' fire 
And gettin' flyer
And what you plannin' for this summer I did it prior
I've shattered shows 
And tattered clothes
Met status quos
This is the south and I am present when it matters most
The startin's hot but pay attention to my latter flows
Givin' brain ain't bad girl don't be that opposed
I flatter hoes
And drink Dom
They always ask me "Is that a rose?"
You mean ros?
Why yes it is
I stopped trying years ago this is effortless
I'm in your house got the key to your home
I am Jeopardy asked Wikipedia known
I am A.A. driven and Expedia flown
So stop jackin' my style
Your in need of ya own, man


Yeah I remember me and, me and D used to talk about this kind of stuff all the time
Like what it's gonna be like when you get closer to your dreams
I didn't know much then but, probably tell you a lil' somethin' now


Mr. Big Dreams no tolerance
Cut you at the house and haven't hollered since
Get bored quickly
He stay grown
So the p-a-trn had to get poured quickly
Ex girl strippin'
I can't stop her
New girl trippin' but I can't drop her
'Cause I need somethin' to balance out the fact
That it's hard to find a woman when you' talented and black
When you hollerin' at labels
And they silencing you back
'Cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track
Well
Gunshot for the young yacht owner
See there's everybody else then there's one top loner
First place is often the worst place
But fuck it I love it here I call it my birthplace
Whenever I walk in they makin' the worst face
Surrounded by Fillipinos I think of the worst case
Watch blue and green diamonds I call it the earth face
I'm gettin' ya cake I tell you how ya dessert taste
I get a dessert plate
Y'all eat pedigree as ya meal
I've been Urkel for some years it's better bein' Jaleel
Though I rock lean snap it's better bein' this real
It's better drivin' a car with the letter B in the wheel
Seat back
Light sayin' tank on E
I got the drank on me
You better bank on me
To be the one and only nigga that you ain't gon' see
In the club with a model spillin' drinks on me
Nah
Gimme 20 in the tank on 3
I'm in the Range bumpin' Keyshia Cole
Singin' off-key like 
I'mma spare y'all
Why you wanna judge me
I don't ever compare y'all
The city is mine
I know it because I'm there y'all
It ain't even started I'm really tryna prepare y'all
Spring '07 second quarter I'm droppin'
With or without a label man I'm committed to poppin'
And take over the summer
Tour to tour hoppin'
I'mma meet a lot of women I'mma do a lot of shoppin'
Really no other option
Spend a lot of money just to make it back
Anybody I dissed in a song I don't take it back
Same rappers that's all in ya face sayin' Drake is wack
Are checkin' my availability just to make a track
I promise mama
I'mma do it 'cause I know I put you through it (I know I put you through it baby)
And I just want you to sit around with ya friends at a dinner table 
And say "my baby's famous and I knooow it" (yeah)
And it wasn't nothin' tooo it
I've drawn it and drew it 'til the pen was out of fluid
The ballpoint run out
Then all joints come out classic
Rappers are fake we can all point one out


Yeah
I'd like to introduce you to the first lady of the ATF (uhh)
Miss Andreena Mill


Closer to my dreams I'm gettin' higher
Yeah I feel it in my sleep
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams


Look
I took a plane to Hawaii with D
And we was trippin' off of the speed at which life progressed
From meetin' Trey in Atlanta to doin' a cameo in his video 
Which made everything right with X (Songz)
I got too many records and not enough shows
For too many rappers and not enough __
Well
You can fill the blank in
They tryna be the best
Just tryna place in the rankin'
Day care play pen drop out
To grade ten drop out
To summer '05 with the grey Benz drop out
Charcoal Charger
Racin' through back streets
On my (Craig David) shit the (Artful Dodger)
Shola Ama
I told her I'mma
'Bout to get my run on so hold the commas
Times've changed now I'm older mama
And these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama
And that's the realest shit I ever wrote
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note
And hi, haters
I'm back off of hiatus
How ya album doin'?
I'm gettin' cake off of my latest
Anticipated like the iPhone
Respected in any city that I roam
Summertime
Wintertime
Dinnertime
Anytime
Bet I am the nigga in my town when I arrive
Home


Yeah one more time 'fore we turn the lights out ladies and gentleman
(Sing it to' em 'Dreena) lights 'bout to go down, curtains 'bout to close but
I want y'all to enjoy yourself on the way out, yeah man
(Yeah man)


Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement


Lat me show what it is
I was born up top but was raised at the bottom of the map
Where the girls all thick and the hottest niggas rap
if you lookin for the goods then we got in the trap like

Ooo wee

Took 'em from white snakes to

Ooo wee

This metaphore might sound a little confusing but

Yall don't really even know me yeah yeah

I done come all way from the Days Inn and all the hotels that stayed in
I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good and now I say it's sittin at amazing'
Girls tryin sell a whole lobby of us 
Hear em all screamin then it's probably is
But I can't blame females, females can't really ignore something this obvious
What you really expect when I strut through town
Two or three days I shut you down
Chilin wit the homie Trey Songz
You call him the prince he rep two up two down
Anyone I know get used to me
Im far from the man that I used to be 
I don't ever really kick game
I know you find it impressing whenever you introduced to me
'Cause I'm a good dude who take pride in that
Need good lovin' I'm providing that
Understand that I'm worldwide
You get who you want it wherever you be residing at
'Cause I do things from the M-town
To the UK
From Spain back out to Texas
This album's for my fans
But yo this hook is for my exes


This one is for you girl
You know who you are girl
You only show you're face
'Cause you know that I'm a star girl
What you trying to to make it
Don't ever mistake it
'Cause my time is limited and I ain't trying to waste it all on you 
You had a chance now It's gone
Oooooh
You had a man now you don't 
Back to the basics
I think I made it
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl


Ain't ya never seen a yougin so fly
Lookin for someone your type
I done left behind the love of my life
Tryin to find another one tonight
And if it's you baby
Let yourself be seen
Don matter skirts
Dresses or jeans
I got that work
Know what I mean
And I'm flexing on my ex if you know what mean


Check this out
from the that she get picked for some take out
Until they slip up and break out
But it's another story over here at Drake's house
'Cause I'm dripped up and I'm drapped out
And I'm lean back
Scoping
Looking for a woman that I should wife
Who got just the right amount of loyalty
Yeah but is still anticipating us living the good life
We go LA, VA
NY, TO
Sunshine in that heat stroke
And them fur hoods in that deep snow
We have breakfast in the bedroom
Break bread downstairs in the basement
Since Jay and Kelz ain't doing the thing no more
Guess me and the boy Songz is the replacement


Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
Ay, Ay, Ay
Let's Go


Yeah Look
It's what you all been waiting for ain't it?
Your weekly entertainment
For me to get a hold of this beat
And go ahead claim it
I'm about to paint a picture
You niggas go 'head frame it
'cause we getting Seinfeld
On some Jerry and Elaine shit
I flow far from mediocre
And if we talking cards
I will fold 'em with the poker
You and your whole crew are like a deck of 54
So it's obvious y'all gon' steady be rollin' wit' some jokers (unh)
And me I'm rolling with some brokers
Like damn, could you niggas get any broker
Got my new girl so content
Just save yourself the embarrassment
Don't even approach her
Disguise yourself, go buy a costume
I am making stocks work while you working stock room (unh)
And I was praying I would drop June but label reps applying pressure to make them pop tunes
So I keep it rockin' for Pete's sake
You fake gangsta rappers are clich
And if you ain't talking dough when you meet Drake
I be in your face like "No speaka la englis"
Soon as you hear it, you quote it
They tryna be the one that I done left out the show with
But trust me I'm aware and my car's right there
Is this interior enough for your ulterior motives
'Cause if you like it you should stick with me
My money good I ain't ever had to flip a key
A lot of ice a lot of cream like Dicky D
Might cut the phone and disappear like Mishy me
But I'm tryna have you on that trip with me
Sliding through Henri Bendel like it's slippery
And your ex-man is a hater, officially
Probably 'cause he know I'm exactly what you wish he'd be
Yeah, that's the reason why he looking hard
'Cause I done snatched the Chips Ahoy out his cookie jar
He just mad 'cause his girl at the house with her tongue sticking out like a Michael Jordan rookie card
Let me address this, pardon me while I fix
Couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix
I guess he thought he could've been Gotti in the flicks
But at this point I'm just poking her body with a stick
Nowadays rapping is a children's hobby
And girl's keep telling me I'm still as snobby
I tell 'em myself who I am feeling probably
Just because I got a buzz like a building lobby
It ain't a song that your ass finna skip
I tried to sell weed, give me cash for the zip
The way your girlfriend pumped me up in the car
Seems like she don't really need no gas for the trip
Millionaire shades, fade with waves, I smirk at a nigga if he still rockin' braids,
That just lets me know that we ain't on the same page and that goes out to every nigga except Trey
Ay, I'm outta here baby
They asked me about the past years and how does it phase me
I wouldn't take it back, nah, not if you paid me
Mister bet you that's expensive cause it's not a Fugayze
Spittin' that crock pot of bottomless gravy
The shit is so nasty, how is it tasting
And you can probably find him walking out of a Macy's
Forget a girl, they just thinking how to replace me
Exit with a joke, leave these niggas some hope
He took that
'Ye beat and you put that shit in a choke,
well, I think that I should leave out on this note nigga keep your two cents,
I ain't tryna leave you broke
Life of a Don, lights keep glowing,
coming in the club with that fresh shit on with something crazy in my arm, (arm),
and here's another hit, Barry Bonds'


I'on think they really ready for my wardrobe
I show up right before the store close
And blow the fee from my last four shows
I do one song and use four flows
She use to be a Christian before...
But now all she wanna do is shop for Christian Dior clothes,
Like baby those are cute I adore those
Me and the salesman build a rapport so
He understands tha fact that I'm spending off shore dough
Cash only transactions, homie,
And please no receipts the feds like to explore those
They can't audit if they don't know I bought it
I been doin' this for years homie, thoroughly I've thought it
Through, what it do, I am currently recorded on a track admitting most of my currency's imported
We're too late now, too legitimate to hit 'em with
Lawsuits even if they're crimes that I did commit
Repeat offender, Anita Baker, playin' in the whip as they pull me over my sweet surrender
I got a Jewish lawyer as my lead defender
A mitchkeit as they say he's a legal bender
And ATF is present every legal memeber
The coalition, we so efficient
You have to be invited or there's no admission
We know tradition
We spend money so don't try to compete if you're in no position
I wish you would listen,
I take you back to this trial
Where I am about to be home again like New Edition
My foot is just solely meant for this shoe it fits in
Used to record in a basement that Rennie Grew was piffin'
When pops turned over keys like a new ignition
If Hov is Jordan, I guess I'm cool with Pippen
'til I mention that I wanna play a new position
No team playin', no screen settin'
Because I wanna win games, coach I'm through assistin'
The take over, the break's over, nigga
And I'm a keep killin' em until the day that Drake's over
The wait's over, the tape's coming
They bullshittin' but I am equipped with great plumbing
The human mentality's so eager to hate something
I try to play it off like it ain't jumpin'
And this the predicament that you found Drake in
The condo that I just purchased sound vacant
'cause I have just been sittin' in this cell
Thinkin' what I coulda done to make my first video ground breaking
And whenever I'm flowing on the mic,
Aside from talkin' 'bout the d I'm throwin' in ya' wife
I treat this one session as if it was my last
And I pretend tomorrow is the day I'm going in for life, like that...


Ok there comes a time when you gotta be like
You know I've come this far on my own
Done a lot for myself
Where to now Ya know
But I just tell myself this one thing

It was worth it it was all worth it
And by this time I understand that I ain't perfect
There ain't a pair of Louis shoes I ain't purchased
And I was on some shit but they served they purpose
And I got verses I got verses
My 16's should be arriving in hearses
They get bodied You see how I murk this
I switch flows much as my girl switch purses
Yeah heartbreak Drake I'll put it on your wife
If I put it in a verse then I put it on my life
Liquor that's over ice and denim that's over priced
And tryna make all my goals for the future come over night
Got got got got damn how time soars
I'm tryna get that house in Toronto with pine floors
Come over watch a season of Flight of the Concords
And I try to put some lotion all over your contours
But uh tell me you surfin let me know you on board
You can't seal up the bottle once all of the dimes poured
Yes I swear to God girl I put it on Lord
I'm tryna show you life through the tint on these Tom Ford's
Ethiopian girl Ethiopian girl with yo long curly hair and yo big ass bootay
Reading all them pro black pro female books
Just let em let em know that you ain't no groupie
You need a prescription a vision correction
I'm young and successful I'm living perfection
And man if 09 is when I'm a see mine
Being cool ain't enough homie I'm a freeze time like that


Take what you want, take what you wa-ah-aha-ant 
Take what you want, take what you want
But, you gotta share it with the world 

Lately I've been murdering and avoiding conviction
This shit is like an addiction conflicting with what I do
Shout out to K Davis and my connect up at Avis
'Cause every weekend I'm rollin' out stuntin' in somethin' new
Fortunately I am at an elevated level
I'm celebrated at home and I am high above it all
But apologies to my fans that be super conscious
Just wait 'til I get my money right and I am going to ball
Ball ball


Check, look
And I ain't tryna get to know nobody but you
Do me a favor tell me what's happenin'
I am drinkin' XO D is sippin' some Appleton
Usually the things I desire I always apprehend
Back again return of the mack again
'Deceiving' was cool I'll never record the track again
Even though my ex is fuckin' one of my rapper friends
I don't wanna seem like I am always attacking them verbally
You can stop frontin' I know you heard of me
Babygirl ya, ya, ya heard of me
Little me
Pay attention I guarantee you it'll be
One of the best, decisions you've made
I'm sonnin'/sunnin' them all I live in the shade
Previously mischievous behaviour was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some conceited degree
Steppin' out the house tryna figure out where cameras from Cheaters would be
But now I need a culprit
I am talkin Long Sands Beach, condo adult shit
I am talkin' all day shoppin' sprees in the mall with
Friends that I ball with
Hear me Trey's girl go and get you some Fall shit
Sweetie I am a track's demise
I will kill this song 'til it actually dies
With a military jacket and some packed supplies
I won't say I'm the best 'til the stats arrive
And all these a-list parties you fraternize
Where you can't wear hats inside it's only slacks and ties
Bu you don't never act surprised
You just hold it down for your boy 'til the plaques arrive
And girl, I used to blow a couple thousand at the shake joint
Now it cost a couple thousand for a Drake joint
I gave up a lot to make a progress
I give it to you, and you take it the best


When I give ya what I give ya
(You gon' like that)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You throw it right back)
It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl 'cause I'm bout that (oh no no)
And when I give ya what I give ya
(You gon' like that)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You throw it right back)
It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl 'cause I'm bout that (oh no no)
And when I give ya what I give ya


(It's The Prince, look here)
Yup it's me again, Songz with a 'z' again
Canadian visitor, lady exhibitor
Play me I'll visit ya
Lay you in critical, condition
So don't get it twisted nigga
But back to the pimpin' nigga
Intercontinental you can catch me laid up
Somethin' with a fly face, slim waist, big butt
That's why I love what I does
Shot a couple videos now we got the city froze
Somethin' like my wrist be
Niggas know how this shit be
Step into the club security never frisk me
Buy so much liquor they give us a couple sips free
I be on Henessy
Straight no cubes
Take me where the women be
I won't lose
Drake take Patrn to the face 'til he wasted
I'm blowin 'til I'm gon' outta space in the Matrix
Call me Mr. Anderson huh 
I'm ramblin'
But at the same time I'm spittin' a flame rhyme
Baby what's your name? they call me the game mind
Most valuable player baby listen it's game time
We could take a couple shots break down ya d's
Take it to the hole post up on me
Let me fill the arena 
I'll be (Gilbert Arenas)
Somethin' like a (wizard) when I give ya what I give ya


Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it
Don't you have a man? (Don't you GOT a man?)
It's alllll-right with me, my girl
We can do anything

Why you over there lookin at me?
Why your man stand-in right beside ya?
The temporary happiness he might provide ya
but you know and I know, that nobody gon do ya like me
Tryna say you like a goalie in line of sight
I know that I feel a bit slowly, I'm kinda like,
"I'on't really wanna hit this girl"
and so she want this chef stick like Napoleon Dynamite
Well, I'ma give it to you, honeybunches
You feel it all under ya ribs like some tummy crunches
All my other girls all up on that subtle shit
They don't wanna cut it, they wanna wrap it and cuddle with
Consequences keep weighin me down
So whenever she thinks I'm serious, I'm playin around
It gets deeper and cold-ER, the funny thing is
I'm writin this in my head and she asleep on my shoulder like...

Look...we had a lil' thing, a wintertime fling
You some (Getback) for your man mistreat thing
But that was then, you know some hush-hush
I ain't never really see a future in us
Plus your man still there, let's be fair
You'll do the same things to me
My feelings never did go past, some late night smash
I'on't wanna take the place of he!
Late night's 85 South on my way to the crib
and somebody got a song for me
I already know what you about, cause I been the other man
and you NOT gonna trap me witcha silly lil plan
It's my bad, shoulda chose a wo-man
but I'm in the mix with this lil' girl playin
I'm sayin, you need to do what you do
I'm NOT tryna take it any further with you, C'MON

Uh...uh...I met her at the bar sippin on Patron
And now it's been three years off and on
Cause the same page, we are rarely off and on
Cause when I'm in, she out, and when she in, I'm gone (c'mon)
We lost contact like ? shalom
But regained it while she was buildin her house a home
wit this new cat, sayin that he doin her right
It just proves that, she don't know what to do wit her life
Cause if so, she wouldn't have to change her strategy
And wouldn't need me to recharge her batteries
One minute she mad at me, next minute it's all good
and I'm in her body like Grey's Anatomy
I don't understand why God sent me to you
And I cain't try to justify that foul shit we do (uh)
All I know is that each time I'm stickin you
I think to myself, "Damn, if only her nigga knew", what?
 yeah..

Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it
Don't you have a man? (Don't you GOT a man?)
It's alllll-right with me, my girl
We can do anything, ba-bayyyy...


Aww man
Ho! Yes!
Hahaha
Yea... Can ya'll hear me out there
It's a lovely night tonight ain't it
Yea I know
I know what they thinkin they, they hear the beat they aleady scared
You know how I get down
But look I'm just gon keep it real

I'd like to know if there is a chemical
Imbalance in your makeup
Yea
(Gotta be something wrong with you baby)
Sometimes I wonder... wonder if you plan
Half of this shit before I wake up
(Ohh Yeah)
Callin my ex-girl or e-mailin my mama (Damn)
You're the only one
That's causin me this drama
And then expect favors (Yea)
When you come in town
And I know if I see you garaunteed it's goin down
Cause

To stay this girll (Ho!)
You couldn't pay me
I respect a woman
But this bitch is crazy (Hahaha)
This bitch is crazy (Yea)
This bitch is crazy
I respect a woman (I do)
But this bitch is crazy

She don't even know
That's the craziest part rite?
She just oblivious to the whole shit like
And you know like I was sayin sometimes
I gotta get my R&B on you know
I wanna wear the wife beaters
With the slit at the top so
I can tear it easy and all that
I wanna sing in the rain girl
You know what I'm talkin bout
Yea
I need a R&B name too like uh... like uh... like
I don't know I'll think of it
Hey!
Hahaha
You crazy man for real
Ho!
Oh well nigga fuck that hoe!
Goddamn
I said it without sayin it man


I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
Bet this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope
Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front lines with my weapon
I am the last hope

Can you i-magine the last breath of Christ?
The last breath of Christopher Wallace on that faithful night
The last step that Martin Luther took as a man
I got the power of my world in my hand
The microphone brings life and death in the blink of an eye
I was born to provoke those born to die
I was conceived to beat all odds like Las Vegas
T-dot motherfucker watch the world rape us
Greatest strugglers hustle to succeed
Cross border smugglers tussle to burn weed
It means that pressure of success in the south
Niggas watchin' what I say magnifying my mouth
I never take back talk I apply the force
Hand blistering from many years of holdin' the torch
When the skin rebuilds it grows tougher than leather
So we can keep on holdin' it forever
My names Kardinall

Jealousy's suttin I haven't felt for years
There's nobody around for me to be jealous of
I bet you do a show in my city and no one cheers
Even if you make the music that ladies and fellas love and dove
I'm incredible fuckin' unforgettable
And when it comes to records 
I will eat it if it's edible
They say the futures always foreseen
That's why I'm steady getting more money, more cream
My flow is stuck in the moment that comes before dreams
I stay avoiding unlucky like 14
And people get behind 'im and they fight for 'im 
'Cause he wont let no other niggas write for 'im
And even when it's quite warm
The attitude coursing through the veins of my city is a ice storm
The name Drake and I don't take it for granted
I just take it you offended 'cause I'm taking advantage mayne


I've got it made thats what I'm talking about
Goin down to the fashion store and get myself fitted out
Goin down to the dealers buy myself a brand new car
So me and my lady can riiiide

Check
I wish y'all coulda seen me back in high school
Backpack grey range black Ac'
Coulda had the stack out just to get a stack back
Double that school dance
Fresh jakes new pants
Back but fuck bitches get money was the new chat
It started out a boy like Hugh Grant
Now I'm a young man doin things you can't


I swear to Lord, same dudes use to laugh at me
See me in the CL6 with half a bead
They know that money begets money so naturally,
Me, I have to blow a couple stacks, hassle free
I'm like fuck ya'll haters on behalf of me
Cause I could flood the city with a staff of three
I'm talkin me and two partners in that caprice
With no copies made, I got the master keys
And fast cars, fast women, fast cash, and c.r.e.a.m
Commode you rappers like plasticine
I have the dream, but dawg, me and success are two things you don't wanna find yo ass between
Back against the wall like plasma screens
The inside of my wallet is pastured green
And you are now hangin with the asthma team
Sweetie catch your breath while I smash the scene
I should leave earth, nothin left to do here
Everyday is Christmas and every night is New Years
Say whatever, I never been concerned about who hears
Call my town Sparta and I'm comin with two spears
I'm tellin you dawg, always got the spring collection in fall
I run my bill up makin executive calls
And with me, women be bulidin these skeptical walls
But once you've slept with one dime, man you've slept with 'em all
Family, money, and music is all I ever knew
My necklace suffer from depression, it's forever blue
Cheer up baby you don't see all this revenue?
I started the game at level two
I'm sayin, stop actin like teen girls are my only market
I parallel to fly and spurk, Tony Barket
And it's cool if you spill something, it's only carpet
That's why I get my interior color only dark shit
Toronto's where you livin today, then you ain't makin records that people are driven to play
I would advise you to really make a move sooner than later
Cause these are only the joints that I'm givin away, you feel me?


I do this for ya'll man
Malice, Nickelus F, it's the REMIX

Lights slow motion, steppin' out the Phantom
All eyes on me, peekin' and glancin'
Leanin' on the wall, with b-boys dancin'
Ears, neck, and wrists lookin' like the king's ransom
One chick, each arm, makin' it a tandem
Flat here costing' like fifty grand standard
Bottles poppin', cars wit' options
We livin' like kings, homie, you just watchin'
And I'm a show for ya, marble flo' for ya
And that thing in the driveway, came with the spoiler
I ain't bluffin', cop jewels off the Russian
Diamonds in the Jesus, look like he's blushin'
Miami breezes, we cross seasons
Escaped indictments, thank you Jesus
Y'all haters ain't even got a clue
While we get this paper, and that's how we do

R-E U-P G-A-N-G
R-E U-P G-A-N-G

Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

Check, the verses I'm writing you might wanna learn it
You hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake might wanna return it
Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl, she'll forget you
And I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is, you just noticed me now but I was here all along
Your vision's just been distorted
I'm so throwed I live this, you ask me what the business
And I write a sixteen and report it
The waiting is over I think music need it
Drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed, I got this dude
They expectations I'mma exceed it
Like a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it
When it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead ish
Finally here I'mma star with the timing
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclining
This for anybody that's searchin for cash, and purchasing fast
You only get the dough when you grindin
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhyming, boy

Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

Ugh, do what you do and I does what I does
These chicks love me, they say boy, you're clean-cut for a thug
You should see the stampede when we rush in the club
It's like a offensive foul how they running to us
Charge all their drinks on that platinum card
Lord I got 'em hooked like the back of a bra
Ugh man, I am, like Sam, I am
I get the green, plus the eggs and ham
And a pen for any beef trying to approach us
Let the sucker burn, I don't even flip 'em over
Nickelus F. teamed with Drake, now you mad as hell
Ain't seen a better looking union since Gabrielle
Well, I'm hot as hell and I don't even need a stylist
Spit the infernal like the Real World Challenge
V.A., Nickelus F., push your mileage
You're running up our animals like white boys, they cow-tip
Everybody knows Cap from the south of Wallis
I ain't gotta use a fist, slap you with the chalice

Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do


Yeah, look...
Me and sos? we from two different walks of life
usually we understand theres a problem we don't talk to vice
the watch is yellowy-green thas sum awkward ice
I never signed for a mill' but been offered twice
I'm awful nice, lyrics that I often write
Spyin no talent rappers to get off the mic
And I could pick you up from work when you get off the night
drop you at the house soon as you get off the pike, man
I flow so cool like autumn nights
When I body this, tell me if the coffin's light
but don't try and tell me that a dolphins white
mislead drake that is not at all polite
It's a shame cause that's how the biz goes
Imagine if these other niggas flop and his blows
Bet I get a co-sign somethin like no time
They'll be trynna sub a nigga in like Quizno's

All I need is sum weight, my scale, sum money for bail
A lil booth at the club for the whole cartel
nigga my drink, my smoke, a bird on E
And somethin heavy on my waist man I'm easy to please
I need my moms, my pa, a bottle of cliqua
the whole ATF you kno who we are..
my women, my money, and leave me the keys
of somethin fast and I'm good man I'm easy to please


D-d-d-d-damn what did I consume
Somethin spinnin fast either me or it's the room
I bet you it's the room cause I don't do no drugs
Or maybe it's that 'tron cause I sure do have a buzz
Baby either way I'm throwed and I am on a mission
So if ya ears a virgin id advise you not to listen
Cause this shit isn't kosher and this shit isn't christian
It's that muthafuckin heat you can find up in kitchen
Girl holla at yo nigga I got that shit for low
Ok maybe I don't but guarantee someone I know
Wait let me slow it down (down) I'm gettin ahead (head)
Plus it's gettin hot so I'm a take a seat instead (stead)
I'm lucky I ain't dead (dead) I'm on a rollercoaster ride ya'll
We all of age and I ain't got nothin to hide ya'll
And in this game I'm a tidal when the tides small
So drop me in and I release just like a time bomb

Every record that I've done the station here done played it
This the city that I run this the shit that I created
They tellin me I'm the one and I haven't even made it
Maybe I'm hearin thangs cause I'm feelin like I'm faded

I'm feelin like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded
I'm feelin like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded


Yeah Man (Aye)
You already know what it is (Aye)
Trey called Trigga (Aye)
Aye man (Aye)
Show them why you rappin homie (Aye)
Look

I aint never been nothin but a underdog
And I aint gonna neva let a nigga hold me under dog
Still ride in the drop
With my mind on the knot
You niggas never take what I got
For my underdog

Just copped new shoes
Whip on two twos
Dick down you two
Throw it on youtube
Tell me what youd do
If I was to do you
Baby after one time
Sure to make you come back
Back like spinal
Stack like dominoes
Catch me out in Mexico
Hasta Manana though
Hasta la vista
Chest full of reefer
Rep for my set till the day I meet the reaper
Petersburg veteran
USA resident
In USA Today it aint a city I aint never been
Scared I aint never been
Yea I aint never been
Nothing but a underdog
But I'm never under yall
Still keep it under there
Right by the underwears
Still in the hood yeah
I aint talking outer wear
They be moving powder there
Which one of you out of there
Wanna get it
Cuz I'm with it
f**k yall the underdog

Said I got my city buzzin
You should take a trip and view it
Shout out to Mr.Rogers
Cuz he's supposed to chop and screw it
And my liscense just expired
So I got to go renew it
Cuz I just bought a truck
And I am dying to debut it
And naw it aint a Buick
I never redezvous it
I'm just in the 'Burg with Trigga
And I'm faded off the fluid
I made alot of money
Then I went ahead and blew it
Now I'm trying to make it back
So how the f**k you want to do it
My nigga you better do it(Aye)...do it
I say this here's a practice song
And lately I been out in Hollywood
Just acting wrong
What up to Jackie Long
I f**k with Jackie Long
I clown other dudes on the low
I like to laugh alone
I get my cash alone
That's why I shop alone
This here's my uncle's car
I drive it and the top is gone
Your skin looks like you bathe in magnesia
And coppertone
And girl I heard your man's a fed
Don't bring that cop along
I'm running every single light
Aint one I'm stopping on
This here's a classic jump
That big things are popping on
So baby wipe me down
I sell a watch and swap a home
I'm in this solo
No I do not have a chaperone
I'm in a proper zone
That's right the doctor's home
This here's my time
And I don't even think your clock is on
I am a trader
And I'm telling you my stock is grown
I run my city
Got it mobile like the lock is gone
Keys out
I aint talking white though
Baby what you be's bout
I mean for tonight ho
If I break them trees out
Pull them Double D's out
So I can J Holiday that ass
Before I leave's out
Holla at me shawty


Yeah, 9th Wonder! Don't judge me man
They tend to say that us rappers are materialistic
They say we lack substance
Me, 'Te and El' bout to prove 'em wrong though

Uh, we know what you're thinking love
You think we out smoking and drinking love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we're early and be showing up extra late love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me

Uh, El' be saying that I'm humble, I'm hella nice
For that I've been approached to sign to Roc-A-Fella twice
Haters tell you all the rumors they heard
And we laugh soon as you come and tell me like I'm Ellen Brice
My groove theory is that when you too cheery
They try to bring you down to the level they at
Well when they are all unhappy, then it gets a little sticky
That's why I am Little Nicky to these devils in rap
But, uh, they ain't thinking Drake get smart girl
Nah, they probably think I'll break your heart girl
Haha, I can't lie, you probably right about it
And if you give me the ass quick, I'll probably write about it
But I hate it when they judge me on how I sound
I mean I spit that influential shit from my town
I don't know why you sitting on the couch
When you see I got a bed, bring your ass here and lie down
You think taking your purse off
Will lead to me, you taking shirts off and then your skirt off
At least I got status because I could've been a local emcee
And you probably would've been worse off
So I'm a take this hat off, and I'm a hit it till I backs off
And then I'm back sorrowful
Cause you thinking you can predict what happen
You the reason I'm thinking I'm getting sick of rapping

You probably think I walk around with my gun tucked and
Swang dick to these hoes like nunchucks
Well, you can think what you want but
I think you've been watching too much BET: Uncut
You need to get real and check out my real life
I ain't a tip-trail, don't care what it smell like
But if you feel like putting all your notions aside
And talking to a real nigga, I'd gladly oblige
First name Phonte, I'd be pleased to date ya
College educated, got degrees in papers
But I'm from the South where if you ain't snapping
Or rapping bout trapping youse a freak of nature
Such an anomaly, speak so well
And talk so collegy, such an astonishing
Contrast to all the bullshit you've been following
On behalf of them, I offer my apologies
Maybe with me you'll unlearn
Putting all niggas in a box of concerns
Me, cause I ain't dumb, shit I'm well reared/red like sunburn
And after me you'll never leave no stone unturned, uh, c'mon

They say you never judge a book by it's cover
Though you appear as materialistic, just like the others
So I followed your words to take 'em in
And I don't see what you saying so they coming off paper thin
That's when I felt that I would need to
Do more than just look you up and down to see if I could read you
And try to get inside your head only
Not just stick my fingers in your middle to get you to spread for me
So what I learned on my path to discover?
Your story took one ugly turn after another
I saw we wasn't on the same page
I would've gave you strong play but your words rubbed me the wrong way
So now I'm closing the case
You only out for the paperback that's written all over your face
No El' will never judge a book by it's cover
Until he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under


Me and you so crucial baby and that champagne so fuchsia baby
I do things that you ain't used to baby
And take you back home to St. Lucia baby
When raindrops hit the tin roof it's crazy,
That's a metaphor did I lose you baby?

When you are wet
And covered in sweat
I wipe your ass down like Boosie baby

I love all my feed back
Tell me to give it to you if you need that
Touch right there whatever the speed's at
If it's over fast then I promise you a relapse

Forget what you guessin' I'm on
And who was in yo past
I'm a freshly grown
Just charge that cell that I message you on
And if you let us girl I'm a bring the dresser along

You hear that professional tone?
Half of that's ice and the rest Patrn
Show up on time for the class I'm teachin
'Cause guaranteed I'm a bring a lesson along

An you just gotta bring yo breasts along
Instead of holding out wondering what it could've been
I confess this address to you and
I'm the postman lookin for a slot I can put it in

With no NY number
Mom's still upstairs I'm two floors under
But my room's soundproof
You so tempted
To satisfy your urge so you don't wonder (yeah)

I know I told you before
I'll grab that for you like holdin' the door
'Cause mines is Polo and yours is Vicky
And they just spread all over the floor, like

You feel so good
You smell so good
You feel so warm
Just like I knew you would
I can't let you go
I can't let you go
I can't let you go

You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You've been a bad girl
Someones gonna have to teach you a lesson
You've been a bad girl
Someones gonna have to straighten you right out
You've been a bad girl
Someones gonna have to teach you
Teach you teach you teach you

You can call me professor
But baby you broke the rules
You won't get the grade you want
Unless you stay after school
You can work it off
Baby I can give you extra credit
But there's something else
You were late to school
Teach you teach you teach you
Girl can I frisk you
Search your body for
You look so guilty to me
If I make you nervous
It's 'cause you're hiding WMDs
And I'm gonna sentence you
Baby you can do your time on me
I can't let you go
I can't let you go

You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You've been a bad girl
Someones gonna have to teach you a lesson
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right out
You've been a bad girl


I can't stop missing you, wish I was still with you
I can't stop missing you NO, NO, NO, NO
I can't stop missing you, wish I was still with you
I can't stop missing you, NO, NO, NO, NO

Nah,
I never needed advice about
All the things you liked to do when it was lights out
I drove nice cars
I got a nice house
But now I'm steady missing you like a strikeout
I always wished I would of cared more
That's my only feeling inside when ever I get a song done
I'm scared that every girl I care for
Will find a better man and end up happier in the long run
Ya, and when she not by my side
And I hear that she gone
Now it's like a shock to my pride
I don't care if she know

Baby 07' supposed to be our year
You confront my worst fears
And I had my doubts every time you was going out
Cause I knew you were tellin' me lies
And I can't get that outta my mind

And I wanna erase but I can't stop seeing your face
In every girl I try to replace

Not tryin to call you when I know I want to
(O wish I,) I gotta fight this feeling can't let it take over me
You just don't understand how much you were apart of me

Damn!
I done walked in here
Lookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year
Think I had the mothafuckin' plan of the year
Which was simply to make groupie fans of my peers
And I get my girl whatever she desire
And my niggas get whatever they require
These rappers old, I'm the reason they expire
Plus I got a city that I Carey like Mariah
Damn!
That punch line was predictable
I still got you shittin' bricks, homie, quit the bull
And we don't need new members
To me the clique is full
And I be getting' the same women that tip the pool
Believe or not
I receive a lot
So, I be wearing the same Gucci that Jeezy got
And I be buyin' the Louie that Kanyizzy cop
And I be rippin' the same reords that Weezy rock
This shit is east pot
That's why I'm ready, man
I'd never copy Norbit like eddie, man
Did you get it? Eddie Murphy was in Norbit
Or was it way over your head?
Did you forfeit?
Yeah, I take a woman shopping in a store quick
Her ass big, she just tryin' to make a four fit
Yeah, they need ot issue out a recall
I'm goin' up and they headin' into a freefall
The fundamental are needed, you playin' street
And I was out at BET, but I didn't see ya'll
These skee-low rappers wishing they could be tall
Lettin' all their fake friends use them like a free stall
Yep!


Damn!
I done walked in here
Lookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year
My shades so dark
And my ice so bright
My buddies and my fans wanna fight your right

'Cause, ain't no nigga like a young money nigga
No, ain't no nigga like me

If I'm with the right niggas, you can scoop a O.Z.
All the hustlers and the bouncers
And the groupies know me
Fresh denim, fresh shades
In a group with no kids
It start up when I touch the door
And I encourage ladies to touch the floor
As soon as we finish cuttin', we can cut some more
Then after you get high, make 'em, get 'em, girl you finna get low
Lights dimmed down
Got alota dough
Plus a hit sound
What you mean you ain't heard?
I come highly recommended
Everybody my friend, even if they been offended
They ain't really got a choice, it's an obvious decision
You tryna make a come up in my city, it's a given
Plus a nigga famous
Plus I got a vision
Not to mention havin' bars like a mothafuckin' prison
They takin' too long
Their records on hold
They threatened by my presence
'Cause I make them feel old
Guaranteed if they drop, they braggin' 'bout what they sold
Just remember where I lived at, 50, 000's goin' gold
Holla at me when you see me, make yourself known
'Stead of hatin' on my music in the comfort of your home
Nigga, be a man
You actin' like a bitch
I ain't actin' like I'm rude
I'm just actin' like I'm rich, rich
Yeah, uh!
Ridin' with Weezy Fuckin' Baby
Are you the type of girl that me and Weezy fuckin', baby?
'Cause I don't waste time, can't yo see a nigga lazy?
And I might need some help
But, you know, Weezy's fuckin' crazy

Straight up lookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year
My shades so dark
And my ice so bright
My buddies and my fans wanna fight your right
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch 'round me
'Cause, ain't no nigga

Damn!
I done walked in here
Lookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year
My shades so dark
And my ice so bright
My buddies and my fans wanna fight your right...


I'm tryin to do it all tonight, I got plans
I got a certain lust for life, and as it stands
Everything is going as right, as it can
They tryin to shoot down my flight, before it lands... before it lands

But you can miss me with all that
Diss me then crawl back
I really wish ya'll would fall back
But gettin rich suppose to solve that
And these days women make offers and who the hell am I to say (no, no, no)
My ex sendin late night text cause she don't know how to let (go, go, go)
She in love
And as for them pretty light skinned models standin in the cold aw yea they with us
Let them girls in for a drink
And I'm all in they ear
Saying she should be the one I see, everytime, that I'm here
But when I'm not really even here
Black surburban with the tint on it
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it
The game got these old hand prints on it
But I'm a be the one to pour cement on it
Uh, and start over
And show up in the mars yellin Tux I don't really give a fuck and we're only getting older
So what I tend to do is think of today as the past
It's funny when you're coming in first but you hope that you're last (you just hope that it lasts)

Throw your one's up in the air
Throw your one's up in the air for her
Throw your one's up in the air
Throw your one's up


Hey there, pretty girl
You know, exactly what you got
And I don't, blame you at all
You can't resist it
Especially when the lights so bright
And the money so right
And it's comin in every single night
She don't wanna leave
She just stuck in

Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas
And she dance, to this song
And she dance, to this song
And it goes, "Hey now now, watch her go down"
Oohh-ohhh-ohh

She doesn't ever worry
If she wants it, she'll get it on her own
She knows, there's more to life
And she's scared, of ending up alone
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
Cause the ones you throw will get her out of

Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas
And she dance, to this song
And she dance, to this song
And it goes, "Hey now now, watch her go down"
Oohh-ohhh-ohh

We all got dreams and we all star reachin'
All start peakin, all-star weekend
One hotel room, and all y'all sleepin'
Housekeeping knock to see if all y'all decent
Young girls envy the life y'all leadin'
Never satisfied with a nice calm evenin'
You be at the games lookin right, all season
But you always with me, on the night y'all leavin'
Ass low, ass low, I always request you
You go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue
Carry you inside, get you some water and undress you
I give you my all and the next morning you'll forget who
Or why, or how, or when
Tonight is probably 'bout to happen all over again
And she live in a mindset that I could never move to
Until you find yourself, it's impossible to lose you
Uh... because I never had you
Although I would be glad to
I'd probably go and tattoo
Your name on my heart
I swear, I start, to think, that I'm going crazy

Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
Cause the ones you throw will get her out of

Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas
And she dance, to this song
And she dance, to this song
And it goes, "Hey now now, watch her go down"
Oohh-ohhh-ohh


I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.

Drizzy,
Oh yeah Trey I fucking feel you,
They be staring at the money like it's unfamiliar,
I get it,
I live it,
To me there's nothings realer,
Just enough to solve your problems,
Too much would kill ya,
And when I leave,
I always come right back here,
The young spitter that everybody in rap fear,
A lot of you all still sounding like last year,
The game needs change and I'm the motherfucking cashier,
Nickels for my thoughts,
Dimes in my bed,
Quarters of the kush,
Shape the lines in my head,
Take my verses too serious ya hate me,
Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture no HD,
Yeah,
I want it all,
That's why I strive for it,
Diss me and you'll never hear a reply for it,
Any awards show or party I'll get fly for it,
I know what's coming I just hope I'm alive for it.

I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.

Yeah,
I want things to go my way,
But as of late a lot of shit been going sideways,
And my mother tried to runaway from home,
But I left somethin in the car so I caught her in the driveway,
And she cried to me so I cried too,
And my stomach was soaking wet,
She only 5'2,
And 48 hours all before I showed up,
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up,
Damn my reality just set in,
And even when the phantoms leased them hoes wanna get in,
I do a lot of things,
Hoping I never have to fit in,
So trying to keep up with my progress is like a dead end,
My girl love me but fuck it my heart beat slow,
And right now the tour bus is lookin like a freak show,
And life change for us every single week,
So it's good,
But I know this ain't the peak though
Cause I want...

I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.

Wise words from a decent man,
Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alicia hand,
This lost boy got fly without peter pan,
And my delivery just got me buzzing like the pizza man,
In person I am everything and more,
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before,
But inside I'm treading waters steady trying to swim ashore,
I'm on a shoppin spree to get whatever is in store,
Just call me shop and bag drizzy,
And call me Mr.damn he ain't coping that is he?
And fans of these freshman is about to get iffy,
While this youngin that you doubting is about to get busy,
I'm a kill it I promise this I know you mad,
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads,
To big homie use a flash if you must,
And I swear I ain't asking for much
All I want is

I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.

It's like I know what I got to say,
I just don't know how to say it to you

Pardon the swag,
But bitches cartate,
Long bread I don't eat shortcake,
How come I can't,
Miss a woman like I can't miss court dates,
Cheese,
But shes not in this portrait,
Life's fine but I don not portray,
I'm on the other side but it is a short gate,
I don't want the glow,
I want the glow ray,
And I'm a fuck the world,
But this is just foreplay,
Tired of hearing bullshit,
Bring her on to cowshit,
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than our shit,
That's word to toronto,
So high up I got birds in the condo,
Ain't that a female dog,
Ask her who I am to her,
And she yell god,
Weezy baby I go real hard
No further details boy.


Uh, when did you get like this
Least you coulda done is gone an give me a warning
I don't regret like this
So I'll be right there when you wake up in the morning
Saying, this just ain't my style
You can't say you're happy either
You don't even smile, for me


Did you agree, we should let it be
And did you agree, it's a must,
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us


When you decided to knock on my door
Did you remember what happened before
The look on your face said you were expecting more
But some things look better inside of the store


Did you agree, we should let it be
And did you agree, it's a must,
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us
Let's call the whole thing off

Leave me, leave me, I can't fuckin stand you
Wish I had the courage to say everything I planned to
My girlfriend, my girlfriend, call herself my girlfriend
Tell me that we posed to be together til the world end
But, ion really feel that
I just really wanna turn the wheels back
Give you all ya sweaters and ya heels back
Convince you that time will heal that
Uh, you look for reasons for us to argue
I swear everytime I call
You jus tell me how I don't call you
Why you do that... do that... do that
Yeah

And did you agree, it's a must,
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us

It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see ya picture
Now they wanna grab the guns and come and get ya 

One time for the homie DJ Screw
Already, I'm feeling throwed in this bitch

Up so high even when I'm coming down
Just met a girl say she from the H-Town
I say my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer
Cup inside a cup, smoking Ghostface Killah
Got these boppas going crazy, nigga I'm the man
I sent ya girl a message, said I'll see ya when I can
She sent me one back, but I ain't never read it
Cause pussy's only pussy and I get it when I need it

I'm telling you, I'm as cold as windows down in the winter
And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner
Airport stunting, flying charters overseas
Full of Dom Perignon and the water for the D's
Don't know why it happens, everytime we alone
But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone
So I'm a sip this drank until that mothafucka gone
And you gon' get undressed and we gon' get it on

I don't give you the time, you deserve from me
This is something I know, I know, I know
So tonight I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston
Taking everything slow, so slow, so slow but I do it to her

Draped up, dripped out, know what I'm talking 'bout
3 in the morning, get it popping in the parking lot
It's on once again and I never pretend
A nigga staying G 'til the end

Ay, yeah, I swear like everytime we find ourself in this situation
You know, I just get that feeling like I'm in Houston
Candy paint switching colors in the light
It's about like 11 p.m. and you just rolling through the city
Bumping that Screw, Big Moe, UGK, Lil' Keke
It feels like everything's just moving slow
Let's take my time, I pace it baby, yeah, I'm gone


Yeah, I appreciate ya patience tonight
It's been a moment since I've done some public speaking
I find nowadays it's just best to keep quiet
But, uh, sometimes you just gotta let it out
Young angel and young lion
You know what it is, uh

Look, I'm the property of October
I ain't drive here I got chauffeured
Bring me champagne flutes,
Rose and some shots over
I think better when I'm not sober
I smoke good ain't no glaucoma
I'm a stockholder,
Private flights back home no stop over
Still spittin that shit that they shot pac over
The shit my mother look shocked over
Yeah, but with a canvas I'm a group of seven
A migraine, take two Excedrin
I'm the one twice over I'm the new eleven
And if I die I'm a do it reppin, I never do a second
I swear niggas be eyeing me all hard
And lying to they girls and driving the same cars
Sittin there wishing they problems became ours
Cause we have nothing in common
Since I done became star
I done became bigger swerving right in my peer's lane
Same dudes that used to holla my engineer's name
One touch I could make the drapes and the sheers change
An show me the city that I without fear claim
What I set seems to never extinguish
Coolest kid out baby word to Chuck English
Count my own money see the paper cut fingers
My song is ya girlfriend's waking up ringer
Heh, or alarm, or whatever
She be here at six in the morn if I let her
But I never get attracted to fans
Cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam
I always knew that I could figga
How to get these label heads to offer 'em good figures
And me doing them shows gettin everyone nervous cause
Them hipsters gonna have to get alone with them hood niggas
It's all good I'm going off like lights when the show's over
Make pasta rent a movie called hoes over
Rest in peace to heath ledger but I'm no joker
I'll slow roast ya, got no holster
Wet glass on ya table nigga no coaster
Burn bread everyday boy no toaster
G and tez got a cig but I'm no smoker
They just handing chips to me nigga no poker
I'm with it, young money, cash money soldier
My cup runneth over,
The same niggas I ball with, I fall with
On some southern drawl shit
Rookie of the year, '06 Chris Paul shit
D.r., c.j, an po' I see y'all
These cases don't workout I hope we can agree on
Making enough to pay any judge Judy off
First thing I'm a do is free weezy, go

And I take probation
I don't want that t.I. and Vick vacation
Private plane, big location
Going to the bank to make a big donation
Yeah, I don't stunt, I stunt hard
And if the food ain't on the stove I hunt for it
But in the meantime you can call me young Roy
Jones junior fighting the drugs and gun charge
Shit, don't leave me un-guarded
And I'm a cheese head word to Vince Lombardi
Word to marky mark leave a snitch departed
All that blood like the red sea parted
My gun go crazy like it's retarded
Red light on it like it's recording
I ain't recording I'm just C-4'in
My currency foreign
We are in a league they aren't
Better dig in ya pocket an pay homage
Better cover ya eyes ya face falling
Watch the game from the side I'm play calling

Oh oh. It's 6 o'clock in the morning at the studio


Why do I feel so alone
Like everybody passing through the studio is in character
As if he acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I don't have the heart to give these bitch niggaz the cue to go

So they stick around, kicking out feedback
And I entertain it as if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing I need back

But it's hard to think of them polite flows
When Stefano Pilati suits are your night clothes
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight close

Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full, now this shit just being lipo'd
Always said I'd say it all on the right track
But in this game you only lose when you fight back

Black-diamond bracelets,
Showing you the basics
I can't live and hold the camera
Someone got to tape this
I make hits and like a bitch that's married, I ain't miss
24 hours from greatness,
I'm that close

Don't ever forget the moment you began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los Angeles, Cabanas, or Atlanta South
Watching Hov's show, embarrassed to pull my camera out

And my mother embarrassed to pull my Phantom out
So I park about 5 houses down
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around

So she wonder where my mind is, account's in the minus
But yet I roll around the fucking city like your highness
Got niggaz reacting without a sinus
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless

And promoters tryna get me out to they club
And say I have fun, but I can't imagine how
'Cause I just see my ex-girl,
Standing with my next girl,
Standing with the girl that I'm fucking right now

And shit could get weird, unless they all down
And so I stay clear, we from a small town
And everybody talks, and everybody listen
And somehow the truth just always comes up missing

I've always been something that these labels can't buy
Especially if they tryna take a piece of my soul
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez, "Damn, Drake fly."
And he just be like, "Silly motherfucker, I know.
That was your bad, how could you pass up on 'em?
He just take them records and he gas up on 'em.
Wayne would probably put a million cash up on 'em.
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em."

Oh they did Po, at least they tried to
And that's what happen when you spitting what's inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
And they think they can market you however they decide to

Nah, but 40 told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
'Cause who have known me, would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest could've fooled me

Boy, and to my city I'm the 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy
I'm just not the social type and campus life is crazy

Understand, I could get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll
Sell that motherfucker to any rapper that I know

'Cause they need it much more than I ever will
I got new shit, I'm getting better still
Little niggaz put my name in they verses
'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal

Future said, "'Cause it's Ye shit you better kill."
And I think this got that making-of-a-legend feel
Problem with these other niggaz they ain't never real
Yeah, it's all I can say


Hands down
I'm too proud for love
But with eyes shut
It's you I'm thinking of

But how we move from A to B it can't be up to me
'cause you don't know
Who I was before you
Basically to see a change in me
I'd be losing, so I just ignore you, yeah
Oh, oho
But your on my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
Oh, oho
But maybe in time, in time, in time
I'll tell you

A little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit, a little bit in love with you
Oh, oho

I know you told me break their hearts
But it's you I wanna take apart
And I will never ever be the first, to say it
But still I they know I ah ah ah

I would do it
Push a button
Pull a trigger
Climb a mountain
Jump off a cliff
'cause you know baby I love you love you
A little bit

You would do it
You would say it
You'd mean it
I would let you do it
It was you and I and I only
Ha, hm

I think I'm a little bit
Little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit
Little bit
Little bit
In lo-lo-lo-lo-love with me

I hope they never find out
What they already know, know, know
As soon as it's official
We'll have to let it go, go, go
So we don't confirm the fling
Keep avoiding all the questions
You could teach me many things
I'm just scared to learn a lesson

The pressures on
Both hearts beat like a metronome
Both n'sync like a Justin song
Feels so right but it's just so wrong
I wonder where my whereabouts?
Where niggas that I know, tryna talk my girl out
And her friends say I ain't the one to go for
She just get jealous 'cause you always get approached more
Oh, well, tell her fall back
caught up in some more shit
tell her call back
Tell her get a man that ain't cheating on her ass
With a girl that I know, yeah, tell her all that, that
And as for you I think I know you're the one
The closest I've come
I'm probably...

A little bit
A little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit
A little bit
A little bit
A little bit in love with you
Oh oho
Lo-lo-lo-lo-love with me
Oh, oho, oh, oho

My name is drizzy
And I ain't perfect
And I work hard
So I deserve it
And I belong
Right where you see me
Ain't on the fence about it
I ain't mister fenny
I got a decent set of manners
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or planner
And I fall in love with girls
Caught  up in superficial glammer
Who dress like Sara Jessica
And live like princess Diana
So often they have addiction
And I'm the one that will feed it
But truly you bad enough
Where you don't really even need it
You could show up to the party
On dirty public transit
And I guarantee the camera man will still be snapping candids
Of you and your possie partying
Drinking what you get handed
With your virgin island tans
All looking like you just landed
I don't really understand it
I'm not sure I'm comprehending
But these girls are having fun with whoever's money they spending screaming

I got to be unstoppable 
Ay ay ay ay you don't like 

My name is whezzy
I'm almost perfect
And I work harder than hard working
Bizarre circus
That's what my bars surface
Therefore I act a clown
Even when I laying on my back I'm never backing down
So over stand me
I got a condo in Miami
And my door mat is always sandy
And I run Louisiana
But I never pulled a hami
And I got a condo in Atlanta
And I always wear a bandanna
And when it come down to stunning
You boys are just bunting
And I swagging for the fence
Your girl hanging from my dick
Your girl singing to my shit like
A lo lo lollipop
She say I get that pussy wetter than a designer shop
And she say I pick that pussy better than her gynecologist
Hold this
Text me whenever you want some more dick
More dick
Old bitch
Young bitch
But I be like damn
All I got is one dick

I got to be unstoppable 
Ay ay ay ay you don't like 


Yeah, uh-huh

Uh, hardly home but always repping
You hardly on and always second
When I'm awake you always resting
And when they call you the answer
You are hardly questioned

I, I'm doing classic shit in all my sessions
Other niggas situations they are all depressing
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions
I just always did my own thing

Now I run the game, you stupid mothersuckers
I see all this money through my Ohio state buck eyes
Shit been going good, but good could turn to better
'Cause you the type to lose her
And I'm about to get her

It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK
You can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on

You can run and tell my city it's on

Yeah, wrong way down a one way
Women don't get saved 'round me even on a Sunday
Damn where I get it from, these niggas always wonder who
Then they meet my pop and tell 'em "Drake is just a younger you."

And shorty wanna party so don't let your girl up out the house
Or there'll be shots on TMZ, of me giving her mouth-to-mouth
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her
I drop two black cars I named 'em Malcolm X and Martin Luther

I don't ever play but I'm in the game lady
They just lose to love, those are tennis games lady
Have you counting money going dufflebag-crazy
Sipping on Pink Floyd and puffing Wayne Brady

Damn, whose line is it anyways?
I'm in a daze
You been amazed
Y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage
I'm on fire yup I've been a blaze

I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right
You look nice
And your frame makes me wanna bowl a strike
Well, alright
Guess I might
Know what? Fuck it. Yes, I will
I am more than what you bargained for
And nothing less than real
Put it to your life

It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK
You can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
Best believe I understand

You can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
You can run and tell my city it's on

Bun B, king of the trill
Also one of the dopest
Whether the streets or on the mic
I'm dope and yes I'm focused

The gangster recognize me for my locc ness no joke it's
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a locust

Or maybe like a python
That's the type of shit I'm on
I wrote this on my iPhone
So let me drop this iBomb

I palm the game like it's a spalding ball and take flight
From the free throw line and slam it down like I'm the great Mike

Bun and Wayne and Drake in here
Man this gon' be a great night
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white

Try to cross me over
I just fake left then I break right
Stupid animal tricks
Like David Letterman's Late Night

This that major moment you've been waiting on for too long
The best that ever did it and doing it on a new song
UGK and Young Money too strong
Bound to be in the green like a crouton
So what the fuck is you on?

It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK
You can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
Best believe I understand

It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK
You can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
You can run and tell my city it's on

I am the leather-jacket, black-glasses, All-American bad boy
I own the swagger supermarket and you, you just a bag boy
'Cause I got that swag boy, the swag you never had boy
Hate and I will leave your chest the color of my flag boy

Soowoo bitch, I do this shit, I'll erase you like I drew you bitch
And I keep that toaster you can come and be my strudel bitch

I'm so uptown
And motherfucker if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeah
And now I'm on that rock shit
But why they let me in
I'm a start shooting in a mosh pit

Fuck is you talking 'bout
Weezy in your mouth now
Weezy what you talking 'bout
(Young Mula Baby)

It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK
You can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
Best believe I understand

It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK
You can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
You can run and tell my city it's on


I forgot to call you on your birthday
You swear you're the last thing on my mind
There is nothing I could do to fix it
All you ever asked me for was time

When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you tell me you're in love with someone else

So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together, make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever
And I realized I waited too long
But please don't move on

You don't need no one else 
You don't need no one else 
You don't need no one else 
You don't need no one else 
You don't need no one else 

You just changed your hair and it looks perfect
Wish I was the first to let you know
Every chance I get to make it better
I just find a way to let it go

When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you tell me you're in love with someone else

So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together, make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever
And I realized I waited too long
But please don't move on

You don't need no one else 
You don't need no one else 
You don't need no one else 
You don't need no one else 
You don't need no one else 

The girl or the world?
You see: someone gotta lose
I thought I could have it all
Do I really got to choose?

What good is all the cash, if it doesn't buy time?
And what good is being famous, if I'm never on your mind?

Night's fallen, light's glowing
And I'm just trying to pay the price owing
And I don't wanna feel the comfort for my ice showing
And I ain't tryna be without you at the right moments
Nigga nice going

Is it worth it? That decision?
'Cause hearts break and I ain't tryna be in that collision
So I'mma dust my shirt and fix my pants
'Cause I better look good, girl
If this my chance I swear

So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever
And I realized I waited too long
But please don't move on

You don't need no one else 
You don't need no one else 
You don't need no one else 
You don't need no one else 
You don't need no one else


Even though your all alone
All I know when I am gone

I just wanna keep you warm
I'm comin' back, I'm comin' back

Yes, I'll be there
Yes, I'll be there

Cause when I'm all alone I think about your face
And how I wanna touch, I'm so far away (I'm So)

All I wanna do is give you all of me now
Are you ready? Are you ready? Yeah

Don't go missing
fly with me
Don't go missing
fly with me, fly with me
Don't go missing
fly with me
check it out, check it out
Don't go missing
fly with me, fly with me

I'm aware that we just met
I don't wanna leave you yet

Promise that I won't forget
I'm comin' back, I'm comin' back

Yes, I'll be there
Yes, I'll be there

About to board a flight
Sittin' at the gate

I just wanna touch you
But I'm so far away (I'm so)

All I wanna do is give you all of me now
Are you ready? Are you ready? Oh


Uh, I'm just so far gone, october's own, Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne screamin' in the phone
See my house is not a home, fuck is goin' on
Where did we go wrong, where do we belong
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meaning if it rains I'm the one it's raining on
When my diamond chain is on still nothing set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city then these rappers that have blown
It's only been 3 Years look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone, I call this shit the calm
Yea, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom, and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be ok and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne
I know you like to worry it'll be better if you don't cause...

You know, everything gone be alright, I promise. A
Pologize to you know, to put ya'll in this position and vent to ya'll but...
40 mom always say, "Don't ask permisson, just ask forgiveness"
You know, so... forgive me.

Uh, And life is so insane, look what I've became, tryna make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention therefore women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that your the one to blame
Tryna enjoy myself with Taz in miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like dwayne
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spottin' me is playin'
So I'm liftin' all alone try not to get a sprain
Hopin' western union doing currency exchange
Cause my dad called and got me feelin' guilty and ashamed
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he payin' for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I could only feel his pain
Cause in memphis tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm fillin' out the form at the counter once a-gain
He say he love me I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why yo girl heart is in a slang
Call me heartbreak Drake I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man I'm just honest as a artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sittin' on my brain
Yea, And see this is the thang
What they viewing as braggin' is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single handed reason I Remain...

Me, Yea... Uh, I said I call this shit the calm.
But I'm the furthest thing from calm.
I swear I'm puttin' on but they always wanna ask what type of act you puttin' on like... Man.


This here is on some truthful shit
It seems like everything I do, your used to it
And I hate hearing stories bout who you've been with

Swear I gotta hide, what I'm feelin inside
So you still think I'm confident and dumb

Is this gonna last? Your up on a pedestal
Are we moving too fast?
Feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past
This why I gotta ask, is 

Anything I'm doin brand new?

Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doin brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Brand new girl

This here is on some remix shit
It seems like everything I do they're leakin it
And I hate hearin stories of who I'm sleepin wit

Thats when I gotta hide who I got in the ride
So she still thinks I'm confident and down

How long will this last
My life is on a pedestal am I movin to fast
It feels like I am in crazy competition wit my past
Thats why I gotta ask. . . .

Is anything I'm doin brand new
Brand new

My deal like Weezy first week
One point Somethin
And my verse is gettin stupider
Wayne if your on Mars
Can you pick me up from Jupiter?
Phone blowin up so I'm cuttin off my cellular
I'm a superstar
Know that on to my Nebula
I will break a leg
Break an arm
And a fibula
When I break it down
When I When I break it down
I hug and kiss the drum kick
I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit
But you can never beat my ass PAUSE
Again DAMMIT ya'll again ya'll
Pretend that we are
Some men that get it on and in
I die before I lose cause I was born to win
If he don't fuck with ya'll
Then don't bother him
And yes I fucked this game
But I won't father them

It's like these days man I'm booked
And I'm busy Dad named me Drake
Foots named my Drizzy
They try to tell me I'll never be nothing
But a Protege but if you watch the VMA's
There's nothin more to say
I got the key to happiness and all the copies
Remember this day like you bought a POPPY
And damn how I get so nice
I done spent it all once
Bout to get rich twice
Surprise party Bitch now it's on and poppin
I always choose dough like it's my only option
Cause money always knows best
Chain Snatch Flow they say get it off yo chest
And I'm what all the fuss about
And if they talkin I bet
I'm what they discussion bout
Hit me at the office same extension
Consider me the reason ya'll should
Pay Attenion

It's CRACK
A yo Drizzy you shoulda said dat on da hook you shoulda been like
Congratulations it's CRACK

Ladies and Gentlemen


Yeah uh huh um uh huh
Hello motherfucker hey hi how ya do'ern?
It's weezy f baby come to take a shit and urine on the toilet bowl bitches pussy ass niggas
Stomping on this beat like a motherfucker sigma
Bad to the bristle
Hat to the rizzle
I'm so official all I need is a whistle
bitch named crystal
Let her suck my pistol
She opened up her mouth
And then I blow her brains out
You ain't met a nigga like me
You probably never will
Riders rollin' with me like 11 wheels
Find out where you livin'
Kill you in the kitchen
The feds trying to clip us but we ain't even trippin'

I'm going in 
And I'ma go hard 
Bitch I'm going in 
And I'ma go hard 

First off you know what it is if you heard drake
Making hoes wobble like a bridge in a earth quake
Never see me out cause I live in my work place
I give you the business so button up your shirt straight
Look at where I landed
You would think I planned it
I'm just doing me and you can never understand it
Chicks get hammered
Big dick bandit
Money flowing like a slit wrist
No bandage
Blowing purple clouds nigga
I'm so sky high
I ain't cutting anybody slices out of my pie
Out of this world though
I'm so sci-fi
And I don't sit still I keep it moving like a drive-by
I just tell the truth and so I'm cool in every hood spot
Twenty one years and I ain't never met a good cop
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doing hook shots
Cover me I'm going in to buck you when the hook drops

I'm going in 
And I'ma go hard 
Bitch I'm going in 
And I'ma go hard 

Hold up wait one motherfucking minute
Its the El capitan I got motherfucking lieutenants
If I said I'm going in then I motherfucking meant it
An if I brought in the club then Imma motherfucking spend it
Cost a few hundred bands an I'm motherfucking in it
No need for a room cause you know I'm fucking in it
She acting like she not but she know she fucking wit it
She said she seen it all I said "No you fucking didn't!!!!"
You ever bust 10 nuts in a two seater!?
She said "I can't feel my legs" I'm like "Bitch, me neither"
I'm going in
Where should I begin?
I don't even know maybe where my blunt ends
An Imma be a legend even when my life ends
An Imma be a legend even when this night ends
Til I do my thang, hop up out it like biem
Bitch I said I'm in so I'm nothing like them

I'm going in 
And I'ma go hard 
Bitch I'm going in 
And I'ma go hard 


This is why I do this shit.
I think they call this, uhm, venting.

Look
Uhh.

This is me.
Still the same.
They want the hits.
I play the game.
No auto tune, but you can feel the pain.
It all comes spilling out like I hit a vein.
What up lil Braw.
What up slum Ville.
I hope you know that yall the reason I have fun still.
The fans thinking that we all signed for one mill.
Equal opportunities rapping, that shit is unreal.
That ain't how it works.
That ain't that how it goes.
And I be getting high to balance out the lows.
And I could use a writer to balance out my flows.
But I never share my thoughts,
This is all a nigga knows.
And every time I try, it opens up my eyes.
These verses are a chance to remembered and reprised.
And I would be performing just as long as I'm alive.
So every word I utter will be mine.

Don't believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please don't be scared of me.
Please don't be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isn't new.
So please don't be scared of me.
Please don't be scared of me.
Oh oh oh oh oh uhh.

I never cried when Pac died.
But I probably will when Hov does.
And if my tears hold value, then I would drop one for every single thing he showed us.
And I'll be standing in a puddle.
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble.
And ima keep it honest.
I'm so tired of being subtle.
Its just me, Forty, O, and Neek standing in a huddle.
Staring at the members of my team.
Who get questioned about they profit from this 40 million dollar scheme.
Just know that I'm in debt for you defending all our dreams.
I hope you tell your family this shit ain't what it seems.
But yall the reason for a lot of my devotion.
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless.
And know I pop bottles cause I bottle my emotions.
At least I put it all in the open.

Don't believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please don't be scared of me.
Please don't be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isn't new.
So please don't be scared of me.
Please don't be scared of me.
oh oh oh oh oh uhh.

Look.
Fuck all yall.
We ignore feelings here.
Premature millionaires.
Welcome to my realest year.
Yeah.
I swear we making a killing here.
I should be on top of the world here just chilling here.
Uh.
But its funny having fans.
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance, and build you up so you could be the biggest in the game.
And realize when your there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same.
Yeah.
And plus things are just surreal at home
People think I've changed just because my appeal has grown
And now security follow me everywhere so I never actually am alone, I just always feel alone.
I think I'm scared of what the future holds.
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those.
Every girl I meet thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes.
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed.
All my old friends think I got a new crowd.
And people seem to notice every time I do smile.
I guess that mean they come few and far between.
Even though am living out what you would call the dream.
Yeah.
And my uncle ain't even messaging me.
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me.
I hope this isn't one of those forever things.
Its funny how money can change everything.

Don't believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please don't be scared of me.
Please don't be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isn't new.
So please don't be scared of me.
Please don't be scared of me.
oh oh oh oh oh uhh.


Money just changed everything, I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Lookin' down from the top and its crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit
When I hear them talking, I just don't know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me it could take a bit
Yeah, and my dreams are who I'm racing with
And you can see I'm pacing it so that I'm always chasing it
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
Octobers own, but its looking like July 4
I just wish they'd let you try it first
This time I'm really going off, fireworks

Today it begins
I missed them before but won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means

All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like fireworks

I'm just such a gentleman
You should give it up for me
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery
I could tell it wasn't love I just thought you fuck with me
Who could've predicted lucky strike would have you stuck with me
Damn, I kept my wits about me luckily
What happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me
And you making it seem like it happened that way because of me
But I was curious and I'll never forget it baby
What an experience
You could've been the one but it wasn't that serious
There was smoke in the air before that was me clearing it
That felt good, all and all I learned a lesson from it though
You never see it coming you just get to see it go
Yeah, I should've looked up in the sky at first
Now I can see it in her eyes
Fireworks

Everything the same but it feels different
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen
And he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin'
It's been years, though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my realtor we built up a better rapport
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city I let her explore
And now she's sayin' she's more lonely than ever before
How many of our parents' marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the heritage classic
Searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic?
Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I want to witness love, I've never seen it close
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first, that's why I'm really going off
Fireworks


Things have been so crazy and hectic
I should have gotten back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
It's probably better anyhow
So if you gotta go
If there's anything I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you looking for a purpose
You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now I'm all singing Karaoke
Further than I've ever been
So if you gotta go
If there's any way I can help

Isn't it ironic that the girl I wanna marry is a wedding planner
That tells me my life is too much and then moves to Atlanta
Damn, of all the places you could go
I just thought you'd choose somewhere that has somebody that you know
I'm always up too late I worry bout you there alone
In that place you call your home
Warm nights and cold patron
I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy
Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest
But that first cut is the deepest
I tried to keep us together you were busy keeping secrets
Secrets you were telling everybody but me
Don't be fooled by the money I'm still just young and unlucky
I'm surprised you couldn't tell

I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And you looking for a purpose

I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous


Yesterday when we were gettin high
You were invited, you would've liked it
Uh-uh-I-I know you all too well
I said that we can kiss the past goodbye
But you weren't excited, there's no way to fight it
You could stay but shorty here I go


Termanology... uh
They call me one thing, but they treat me like another
I'm cheatin but do I love her, well more than any other
So it's personal, to paint you this type of picture
When your wife is like your sister, seems you barely ever miss her
But another dude kiss her, you lose it, you wanna diss her
Wanna hit her, like you hope no one do to your sister
Go figure, I ain't got a missus
They say it's none of yo' biz when them boys call their miss
And the hall's shatterin, cause life is like a battlefield
And y'all battlin cause, you got you a rapper deal
So I guess you start feelin how those rappers feel
Raw dog, hope she go and get that mornin after pill
But if she get knocked up you gon' have to peel
Or your career gonna be pushin up daffodils
Take care of yo' kid, go check your mistress
Hit the lab and record, go handle your business
What type of life is this? So many different choices
Too many different opinions, too many different voices
What am I afriad of, just to say love?
I love you baby but, this is what I'm made of
And I'ma be me, cause I can't be no other
So I don't know if Aaliyah's gettin a little brother
But all I know is I already got one baby mother
And that's too much trouble, sorry I can't love you


What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say - you promised me you would never change
Ohh, oh oh, ohh, oh oh, ohh
You promised me you would never change
Ohh, oh oh, ohh, oh oh, ohh (ohhhhh)


Uhh, am I wrong for makin light of my situation? Clap on
When 40 got some shit for me to snap on
Now that I'm on I don't really wanna worry 'bout gettin back on
I'm just tryin to stay on, get my fuckin buffet on
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursin home
And I'll be actin like I don't know how to work a phone
But hit redial, you'll see that I just called
Some chick I met at the mall that I barely know at all
And, plus this woman that I messed with unprotected
Textin sayin she wish she woulda kept it
The one that I'm layin next to just looked over and read it
Man I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is, I'm holdin on by a thread it's
Like I'm high right now, the guy right now
And you could tell by lookin in my eyes right now
That nothin really comes as a surprise right now
Cause we just havin the time of our lives right now


Well alright, uhh
I live by some advices girl, Lisa told me
The other day Lisa told me that she miss the old me
Uh, which made me question when I went missin
And when I start treatin my friends different
Maybe it was the fast-paced switch-up
Or the two guns in my face durin the stick-up
Maybe cause a girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up
Or the fact I haven't seen 'em since they locked Big Rich up
I know, but same time I'm quick to forget
I'm 'bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets
Burn it all, burn it all, I'm startin it fresh
Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed
Did I just trade free time for camera time?
Will I blow all of this money baby, Hammer Time?
Yeah.. I just need some closure
Ain't no turnin back for me, I'm in it 'til it's over


Oh, baby, yeah

Days in the sun
And nights in the rain
Summer is over, simple and plain
Found me some fun that's good for the pain
Already told you, I don't feel the same
I don't feel the same

Anywhere I go
I can't help but show
I don't feel the same
Anywhere I go
I can't help but know
I don't feel the same
Anywhere I go
I can't help but know


How did I end up right here with you
After all the things that I been through
It's been one of those days
You try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out
Let's get right
Now that I'm here baby

Show me a good time

I live for the nights that I can't remember
With the people that I won't forget
Spending all the money I just work my ass off
For doing things that I won't regret

I've been waiting way too long long long long
Tellin' everybody that I know we about to be on on on on
I ain't tryna look like I lie to these niggas that I came up with
That's my team,
never would I let a woman come between
What we doing right now
This our dream,
Wu Tang Clan niggas want that cream

I'm the Osiris of the shit right now
Go to guy for the hits right now
Whatever you wanna drink girl pick right now
If you can't hold your liquor, better quit right now

How did I end up right here with you
After all the things that I been through
It's been one of those days
You try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out
Let's get right
Now that I'm here baby

How 'bout you and all your morals

Make the most out of tonight

Understand girl, we fam girl
Can't get me right and not do Wayne
Cash money young money pop champagne
Presidential suite girl Barack Hussein

Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg
People really hate when a backpack rapper get rich
And start livin' that life dawg
Feels like when you get into that paper hip hop hates ya
They would do it just like I do if they could
It's in our nature

Ah, young and rich and out of control
Out in LA blowing clouds of the killer
I came up in the underground though
So I'mma spend another ten thousand for Dilla

Call me over-rated or created or too jaded
Because any way you put it bitch I made it, YUP

How did I end up right here with you
After all the things that I been through
It's been one of those days
You try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out
Let's get right
Now that I'm here baby

Kush rolled, glass full, I prefer the better things
Niggas with no money act like money isn't everything
I'm having a good time, they just trying to ruin it
Shout out to the fact that I'm the youngest nigga doing it
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel, every time
She ain't trying to pop that shit for pimp okay well never mind,
I I I tried to told you, Drizzy still ain't nothing nice
Bracelet saying you should quit, cars saying fuck ya life
Okay now we outta here
Toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up
I got the voodoo for you bitches, yeah
I'm busy getting rich, I don't want trouble
I made enough for two niggas boy stunt double
Fame is like a drug that I've taken too much of
But I never ever trip
Just peace happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does

I'm about whatever man
Fuck what they be talking about,
They opinion doesn't count,
We the only thing that matters (oooh)
So we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night
Whole crew's in here
Cause I don't really know who Imma lose this year (oooh)
Man I love my team
Man I love my team
I would die for them niggas (oooh)

Yo, if Drizzy sayin' get her Imma get her
I got that kind of money that make a broke bitch bitter
I got that kinda... wait wait fixate!
Which bitch you know made a million off a mixtape?
That was just a keep sake
Bought the president the Louis presidential briefcase
Never been a cheapskate
We got the Hawks I ain't talking about the Peach state
Man for Pete's sake scratch that, sweepstakes (hahahaha)
Fuck I look like hoe
I look like yes and you look like no
I'm a bad bitch I ain't never been a mixed breed.
I'm on a diet but I'm doing donuts in a six speed
M M M6 from a M2
I see a lot of rap bitches on a menu
But I collect 100 thou at the venue
And pop bottles with my team
Young Money till the death of me

I mean we can even rock them shoes if it don't got a comma on the price tag, you know
I mean, I mean but then again who ..who..who looks at the price tag, you know

Oh yeah we in this bitch
Oww, oww, oww

You getting ready so I know we gon' be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyle
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym step on the scales stare at the number
You say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer
And you don't do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself you're the fucking coldest
Intelligent too ooh you're my sweetheart
I've always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all, and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look I really think that nobody does it better
I love the way you put it together

Well aren't you a breath of fresh air
From all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
They get a baller think that they ain't got to pick a career
Guess they plan on sucking dicks until some millions appear
Like "voil!" You do it right he might just buy you a car
Now she play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar
Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
I say I'm buying you decline, that is kinda bizarre

Independent with the demeanor of an R&B singer
Naked ring finger (check)

Closet full of brand new clothes and hand bags

As we proceed

Uh, 5 and a half in boys
Ass is off the hook
Cinderella bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to
Better late than never
But never late is better
They tell me time is money, well we'll spend it together
I'm down for whatever
You just lead the way
We go to dinner you don't even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I ain't never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas
And enough money to loan us a little something extra
Should we ever need it
If it sounds like you then let me hear you repeat it

that if you were a star youd be the one Im searching for
all the girls they got attention
but I just always feel like they're in need of something you got
its obvious youre pretty

Yo, this is really one of my dumbest flows ever
I havent slept in days, and me and my latest girl agreed to go our separate ways, so Im single
Thinking about what we had and missing you,
But I aint Santa, I got something for these bad bitches too
I mean paparazzi on me, trying not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the women that I brought out
Baby, dont hold on too long cause thats how them stories start out,
And all those girls that played me eat your muthafuckin heart out, its Drizzy
Always gone but never hard to find
And since you cant escape me, do I ever cross your mind?
Because all this shit is new to me, Im learning to behave,
And still spending every dollar they encourage me to save, but Im good
I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle,
Im looking forward to the memories of right now
Never forgettin from where I came,
And no matter where Im headed, I promise to stay the same

Im just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl, Im the realest nigga she been around
When I pull up in something new and park it by the haters,
And when you get to talkin bout the greatest
I just really hope that (youd think of me) 
I'm doin my thing 
(Cause Im trynna be unforgettable)

This just might be my realest flow ever,
When I say for life, yall say forever
Its hard, but its fair, I told that girl "Life hurts"
The closest you gonna get to this is a Pac t-shirt
The names Young, baby, you know I live that thug life
The good die young, so Imma need a thug wife
Yeah, Im talking his and her firearms
Know our jewelry prolly louder than a car alarm
Yeah, Im in my "used to have to sneak the car"
Now my insides are lookin like a snickers bar
Yeah, Im talking caramel leathers,
Damn right, so fly I need feathers
She saying shit in them streets, so whats the deal?
And Ive done everything in the A, but fuck Chilli
So welcome to my life, no two days the same
Like for yall to meet the love of my life, her names the Game

Got this top dropped on this beautiful night
This beautiful night to live my beautiful life
Pain hurts like a cut from a beautiful knife
Just know she right here on my hip, my beautiful wife
Yeah, Drizzy we got em lil brah,
Unforgettable, youll never forget this, ya understand me?
Timeless homie, unforgettable

Let me know, let me know


Ive been up for 4 days
Getting money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold spades
Rolex's, chauffeurs, and low fades
I keep thinking how young can you die from old age
The always tell me no one is working as hard as you
And even though I laugh it off man its probably true
Cuz while all of my closest friends out partying
I'm just here making all the music that they party too
But party on, party on, all night nigga
I got these new rappers nervous prom night nigga
I grow tired of these fucking grown man liars
Story tellers, they aint even need a camp fire
Uhh, but I just wanna tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
This sh-t feel like when fredro star was a sunset park stunting hard in his yellow goose
Ya, and I'ma motherfucking missed target
But a target none the less, and I just started
Was that directed at Moi?
Cant be, they must be talking to themselves Hov, hands free
Yeah, and I'm just filling up this daily planner
Getting busy cuz I'm a star, no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talking in their music
And I just say I wrote it for yo girlfriends Kelsey Grammar
Yah, that's what life becomes when you doing you
Welcome to Hollywood don't let this town ruin you
And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwing you
Just know that she gon tell another nigga when she through with you
Don't get impatient when it takes to long
And drink it all even when it taste too strong yeah
I gotta feel alive, even if it kills me
Promise to always give you me, the real me

Who would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
(Hey, Guru, tell homegirl to go to open that Ace right there),
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down

OWWWWWWW, Hov turning heads like OWLSSSSS

Triple entendre don't even ask me how
Con-Edison Flo I'm connected to a high power
Bright lights will make your whole city light up
A trillion watt light bulb when I'm in the night club
I just landed in that G-450, caught the mayweather fight cuz his satellite was crispy
Uhh, yall can miss me with the money talk
The smart moneys on Hov, f-ck what the dummys talk
I don't do to much blogging, I just run the town, I don't do to much jogging
I aint gotta scar yet, you fucking round with me and my dogs is far fetched
Drake, heres how they gon come at you
With silly rap feuds trying to distract you
In disguise in the form of a favor
The Barzini meeting, watch for the traitors
Uhh, and I've seen it all done it all
That's why none of these dum dums could done him off
The summers ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like windows 7
You let em tell it they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was, cool as the fonz was,
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry mama I'm promised they wouldn't change me,
But I woulda went insane, had I remain the same ME
Fuck niggas, bitches too
All I got is this money, this will do

Who would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
(Hey, Guru, tell hom' to go to open that Ace right there),
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down
I'm gon' make this go

Hate is temporary love is necessary
I went from eatin pussy to eatin commissary
Damn I am? the sickest I need therapy
You can buy the answers but you cant afford to question me
First off I dont need you second guessin me

And id be over if it was a spliff
?I'm feelin like elvis jailhouse rock
I'm not tupac I'm the new pac
Behind bars but the bars dont stop 
Recordin over the phone hope the call dont drop
Drizzy dot the ball I know the ball wont drop
And I pray none of my kids ever  wanna be cops

Drizzy back up in this thing, I'm ready, what's hannenin'?
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm 'bout my paper like a motherfuckin' scratch-and-win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothin' ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, yo' bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me, I look like I hit the lotto twice
(Drake, you got 'em, right?)

Neeks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ got my credit cards and a lot of ones

Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire, she should work tonight
Call up King of Diamonds and tell Chyna it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table, stackin' dollars to the perfect height
Work somethin', twerk somethin', basis
She just tryna make it so she right here gettin' naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her but I could never love her
'Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz 'bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feelin' sorry for whoever gotta sweep up
Yeah, bills everywhere, trill everything
And Drake just stand for Do Right And Kill Everything
I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fuckin' did it
And girl, I'm fuckin' serious, I'm wit' it if you wit' it
'Cause yo' verses turn me on and yo' pants are mighty fitted
Ugh, damn! I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch 'em stealin' flows 'cause I swear I never loaned it
And life ain't a rehearsal, the camera's always rollin'
So come and get a portion of this money that we blowin'

Yeah I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone

Ooh, shit, motherfucker, God damn
Kickin' bitches out the condo like Pam
Gettin' money every day, I'm a groundhog
'Bout to scoop ya girl up like a ground ball
I walk light so I don't piss the ground off
Man, I swear, my bitches do it 'til they suck the brown off
Ew, that's nasty
Yes, I am Weezy but I ain't asthmatic
James Bond cologne, honey I put on
Make 'em run and tell they friends like a marathon
Voice baritone, haters carry on
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Money's Jerry Sloan, I turn every stone
When she masturbate to me, that's how she learn every song
To the women I condone, better write me when I'm gone
No, I'm not that thuggish, not that ruggish but I do pack Bone
Uh, I'm a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
It's only me and her 'cause the Bugatti a coupe
It's Blood gang, slime, but I parlay with Snoop
I ain't lyin', I shoot, you don't need signs for proof
Turn you to a vegetable like you lyin' in soup
And when I'm in the booth, bitch, the lion is loose
Man, I got so many styles, I am a group
Ha ha, damn! I'll be gone 'til November
But fuck it, I ain't trippin', I know Drizzy gon' kill 'em

Oh-whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa


All night I - been staring--can you tell I want you?
Can't be too - wide open--there's nothing I won't do
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-whoa
Just thought you should 
Know-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-whoa-ooh

That's when you start to laugh (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Saying I just want what I can't have (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Won't even give me a chance (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew
This is serious...Unh

I wish I - wasn't famous
I wish I - was still in school
So that I could have you in my dorm room
I would put it on you--crazy

 Ho-whoa-oh yeah


I'm more than just an option
(Hey, hey, hey)
Refuse to be forgotten
(Hey, hey, hey)
I took a chance with my heart
(Hey, hey, hey)
And I feel it taking over

I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

I'm more than just a number
(Hey, hey, hey)
I doubt you'll find another
(Hey, hey, hey)
So every single summer
(Hey, hey, hey)
I'll be the one that you'll remember and

I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

It's more than just a mission
(Hey, hey, hey)
You hear, but you don't listen
(Hey, hey, hey)
You better pay attention
(Hey, hey, hey)
And get what you've been missing

I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

Too many times I've been wrong
I guess being right takes too long
I'm done waiting, there's nothing left to do
But give all I have to you and

I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart


You could thank me now
uh, go head
Thank Me Later yeah I know what I said
but later doesnt always come so instead
its okay,
You could thank me now
uhh, yeah, well alright, here I go

Mahalo from the hardest act to follow
lately Ive been drinking like theres a message in a bottle
alohas to women with no ties
to men that I know well
that way there are no lies
you could thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas
Im on the brink of influential
Im here for you niggas
I guess a hit doesnt add up to a career for you niggas
I must have been hard to watch,
what a year for you niggas
its December 31st and we in Miami just meditating
you got the resolutions, we just got reservations
living out a dream, it feels like I stayed up
and we just wanna party, patron straight up
fuck that old shit, Im on new things
OVO clique, Red wing boot gang
yeah we want it all, half was never the agreement
whod thought the route we chose would ever end up this scenic
I could relate to kids going straight to the league
when they recognise that you got what it takes to succeed
and thats around the time that your idols become your rivals
you make friends with Mike but gotta AI him for your survival
damn, I swear sports and music are so synonomous
cause we wanna be them and they wanna be us
yeah so on behalf of the demanded
and the entertainment that you take for granted
you could thank me now...
and oh my goodness youre welcome
youre welcome
at this point me is who Im trying to save myself from
rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them
cause they think that I can help them get back to where they fell from
but drink up because everyone here is good tonight
except the niggas that I came with, they good for life
yeah, thats how you know its going down
in case another chance never comes around...

Uhh, shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
I think Im spending all my time with the wrong women
I think I have a chance at love but knowing me I miss it
cause me dedicating my time just isnt realistic
man the good girls went silent on me
they got a boyfriend or left for college on me
and all the bad ones I used to hit her friends now
that make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
but do I ever come up in discussion over double pump lattes
and low fat muffins, do I?
Or is missing what we had outta the question
Im probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
I got flows for the Marilyn Monroes whos there before it all
I guess thats how it goes
they hear about your cons or focus on your pros
and love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul
but those same ones from your area will grow
into women that are ready to get married at hello
because of what they allow
where are they all now
I know there somewhere watching so Im trying to make them proud
searching for the meaning
youll find it next to me
and tell me Im the highest, guess we finally get to see
Im feeling like Nas who am I to disagree
they say that doors open up as soon as you find the missing key
its probably why Im in this bitch shining
jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded
and the bandwagons full but you can try and run behind it
Im sorry, poolside drinking
margharita rounds
shout out to my city though I hardly be in town
Im the Black Sheep, but Chris Farley wears the crown
and I know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down
Im in the world where things are taken, never given
how long they choose to love you will never be your decision
and Im aware that this could be the last time you listen
so while Im still here in this position...


I forgot about you last night
For the first time in a long time I did, ohhh
I was caught up in these drinks they keep on making
An amazing conversation
With this girl named Lorraine, who says she's from L.A.
And keeps makin me laugh and even asks if she can pay
Ohhhhhh, she could be good for me
Ohhh, that's when you text me
Tell me that you miss me, I forget about Lorraine
And the fact she's right here with me
She's starin in my face, somethin had to change
Thought that all these feelings went away
Ohhh...

I hate getting, messages from you, from you
It's like you know the perfect shit to say
Fucks up my whole day
I thought that all these feelings went away
I hate getting, messages from you, from you
Especially when you say you should've stayed
Fucks up my whole day
I thought that all these feelings went away
Ohhh

Ooh, I hate the shit you do

I hate the shit you do, I hate the shit you do
But I still text you back, say I miss you too


R.I.P. to the girl you used to see.
Her days are over. Baby she's over.
I've decided to give you all of me.
Baby come closer, baby come closer.

Kill 'em all, switch it up.
Put it on, zip it up.
Let my perfume, soak into your sweater.
Say you'll be here soon, sooner the better.
No option for her, you sayin' no.
I run this game, just play your role.
Follow my lead, what you waitin' fo'?
Thought it over and decided tonight is the night.

Yeah I hear you talkin', don't know who you tryin' to flatter.
Got my mind made up. I-I-I'm ready for ya.
I'm in control, but with you bein' the man,
You don't seem to understand that I-I-I'm ready for ya.
I-I-I'm ready for ya.
I-I-I'm ready for ya.
So keep thinkin' you the man,
'Cause it's all part of my plan.

I wonder if you'll be able to handle me.
Mental picture, no cameras please.

Yeah I hear you talkin', don't know who you tryin' to flatter.

I-I-I'm ready for ya.

Uh, red lipstick on the wine glass cameras in my mind,
Flash, black lingerie, white diamonds, what a contrast,
I know you get impatient as the time pass
You say you want it fast... define fast
'Cause I can speed it up, and make it last
And I could audition for this, and I could be part of the cast
And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past,
And make damn sure you never forget it
Committed
I'm ready, I'm with it... still here like a statue
Pink champagne, green ink in your tattoos,
You say you got baggage, well I'm packed too
Plus I got a sex pistol, pointed right at you "BANG!"
The baddest women ever and the hardest out,
Proven over and over again that's why I'm hard to doubt
Plus I'm Young Money 'till the death, I took the carter route
I'm more than ready too, hope of something that you thought about

Yeah I hear you talkin', don't know who you tryin' to flatter.
Got my mind made up. I-I-I'm ready for ya.
I'm in control, but with you bein' the man,
You don't seem to understand that I-I-I'm ready for ya.
I-I-I'm ready for ya.
I-I-I'm ready for ya.
So keep thinkin' you the man,
'Cause it's all part of my plan.

Who else really tryin to fuck with Hollywood Cole? I'm with Marley G bro
Flyin Hollygrove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you somethin that you prolly should know
This that (Slumdog Millionaire) Bollywood flow
And uhhh, my real friends never hearin from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same buildin, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls is down to roll
I hit the strip club and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I been sippin so this shit is movin kinda slow

Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex chaaaange
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggaz know I rep my gang like Jesse James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fuckin plaaaane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance - amen
As the world spin and dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playin in the saaaand
Uhh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggaz can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on the paper trail, it ain't no tellin where it took me

Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red
Limpin off tour cause I made more off my second leg
Muh'fuckin Birdman Junior, 11th grade

Flo' so nice you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn, where you stumbled at? From where they make gumbo at?
Kane got the fuckin beat jumpin like a jumpin jack
But you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
Hip-Hop, I'm the heart of that, nigga nothin short of that
President Carter, Young Money Democrat, uhh

Young Mu', Young Mula baby!


Somebody remind me where I am that's right Im at home,

the smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong
I know they ain't getting money like we do so its on.
I was looking for the one now Im feeling dumb for thinking that it was you
I was wrong now Im back up in this bitch going harder than I did watch me do it

And Imma do it all
feeling like the old me
you dont even know me
Imma do it all
Imma do it all
Probably why Im back up in this bitch going harder than I did
watch me do it

tonight Im into breaking up
somebodys home
Im drunk as ever
Im not alone, Im with my people
I know you love it
i dont just do it
I over does it
I be getting money so long
its just paper to me
take all my memories with you and just erase it for me
you can never reminisce when you forget it all
careful what you wish for, you might just get it all
Now my life is angel hair and pignot grigio
baby forget about it
I'm headed wherever this muthfucking jet is routed
you cant have my heart the doctor told me Id be dead without it
my judgements never clouded
thats why Im steady yelling weatherman weatherman
Im about whatever man
Im tryna fuck with tinkerbell in never neverland
but Im polite about it

Ive had a glass or too so somebody remind me where I am

Tryna get the green like Im waiting at a long light
broke just doesnt suit me girl and every night is prom night
whered I just put my bow tie
millionnaire multi
Rest in peace to BIG and praises to the most high
getting stupid paid off of smart decisions
Im the man now, I guess that parts a given
so someone please tell me the problem with my competition
I ask whats up and they just say the cost of living
I love from it though, Ive been down and I got up
bring a hundred thousand to the club and light your spot up
and me falling and landing in love shouldn't happen
because everythings easier to get into than get out off
but someone show me to the owner of this city
because the owners always seem to be the only people with me
Im still the mafia, still run the commitee
NY forever nigga, Diddy,


"Good God Almighty. Like back in the old days. You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had champagne in the studio, of course, you know, compliments of the company, and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last, all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow..."

Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money
Dollar dollar bill y'all

After hours at Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boostin' my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talkin', say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents, but thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink, I could murder word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are

Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money
Dollar dollar bill y'all

I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all-black Maybach but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my Jess
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Chang, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
'Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too
Shout out to Worldwide Wes
Everywhere we go we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feelin' us
The homie said, "Hov, it ain't many of us."
I told him, "Less is more, niggas. It's plenty of us."

Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money
Dollar dollar bill y'all

Cake, cake cake cake cake cake
500 million, I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a carrot cake
Now here's the icing on the cake
Cake, cake cake cake cake
I'm just gettin' started, oh yeah we got it bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Biggs made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans'a tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci air bag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus, grab the wheel

Look, fuck all that "Happy to be" here shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna little bro me dog
Like I should fall in line, like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy and not say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressin' different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior
And not talk my shit and do it major like the niggas who paved a way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same, man, I'm doin' it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feelI don't knowguilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
But I thought, "Fuck." It's worth it to share it with someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time. She a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her that she could live with me if she needs to.
I got a compound but I think she straight
'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me out of the back room
Where I was rapping with Jas over beats
That I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway three months later I'm his artist he probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me always couldn't believe when he called me you never know it could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti and did that shit 'cause it's something to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dog, nothing was the same, dog


Yesterday when we were gettin high
You were invited, you would've liked it
Uh-uh-I-I know you all too well
I said that we can kiss the past goodbye
But you weren't excited, there's no way to fight it
You could stay but shorty here I go


Termanology... uh
They call me one thing, but they treat me like another
I'm cheatin but do I love her, well more than any other
So it's personal, to paint you this type of picture
When your wife is like your sister, seems you barely ever miss her
But another dude kiss her, you lose it, you wanna diss her
Wanna hit her, like you hope no one do to your sister
Go figure, I ain't got a missus
They say it's none of yo' biz when them boys call their miss
And the hall's shatterin, cause life is like a battlefield
And y'all battlin cause, you got you a rapper deal
So I guess you start feelin how those rappers feel
Raw dog, hope she go and get that mornin after pill
But if she get knocked up you gon' have to peel
Or your career gonna be pushin up daffodils
Take care of yo' kid, go check your mistress
Hit the lab and record, go handle your business
What type of life is this? So many different choices
Too many different opinions, too many different voices
What am I afriad of, just to say love?
I love you baby but, this is what I'm made of
And I'ma be me, cause I can't be no other
So I don't know if Aaliyah's gettin a little brother
But all I know is I already got one baby mother
And that's too much trouble, sorry I can't love you


What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say - you promised me you would never change
Ohh, oh oh, ohh, oh oh, ohh
You promised me you would never change
Ohh, oh oh, ohh, oh oh, ohh (ohhhhh)


Uhh, am I wrong for makin light of my situation? Clap on
When 40 got some shit for me to snap on
Now that I'm on I don't really wanna worry 'bout gettin back on
I'm just tryin to stay on, get my fuckin buffet on
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursin home
And I'll be actin like I don't know how to work a phone
But hit redial, you'll see that I just called
Some chick I met at the mall that I barely know at all
And, plus this woman that I messed with unprotected
Textin sayin she wish she woulda kept it
The one that I'm layin next to just looked over and read it
Man I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is, I'm holdin on by a thread it's
Like I'm high right now, the guy right now
And you could tell by lookin in my eyes right now
That nothin really comes as a surprise right now
Cause we just havin the time of our lives right now


Well alright, uhh
I live by some advices girl, Lisa told me
The other day Lisa told me that she miss the old me
Uh, which made me question when I went missin
And when I start treatin my friends different
Maybe it was the fast-paced switch-up
Or the two guns in my face durin the stick-up
Maybe cause a girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up
Or the fact I haven't seen 'em since they locked Big Rich up
I know, but same time I'm quick to forget
I'm 'bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets
Burn it all, burn it all, I'm startin it fresh
Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed
Did I just trade free time for camera time?
Will I blow all of this money baby, Hammer Time?
Yeah.. I just need some closure
Ain't no turnin back for me, I'm in it 'til it's over


I feel good,
I got some time off,
Girl it's been so long,
That you had fun cause I'ma need a cab just to get me home
And maybe you can call in sick,
And bring it to the crib and get all this dick
I know, I know I'm blunt but how real is that?
You want that feelin' back
But you should know

I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
And even though we let it go it's better that you know

I still..
I feel good,
I got some time off,
Girl it's been so long,

And bring it to the crib and get all this dick
I know, I know I'm blunt but how real is that
You want that feelin' back

I still got it for you, I still got it for you
And even though we let it go it's better that you know

Now when it come to making money I'm a printing press
When it come to being Trill I'm a litmus test
I run it like a fitness test
And when it come to making history I'm like (?) son
A million ways to die you already chose one
A million dollars stacked it sounds like a good beginning
We on the top now go back and tell the hook we winning
And while ya there let em know we did it just for them
I made them cough the cash up and left them just the phlegm
Is that the King of the trill go tell em yes it's him
And his testosterone is up who's got the oestrogen
I like your girl and I think she like me even more
I hit her with that heave and ho and them I'm leaving bro
The dirty South's finest and dirty south's behind us
Now thats a plus on the report card not a minus
Keep your security blankets because I'm not your lighters
You got a problem with us you know its just as hard to find us


Uhhh, since your telling on me
Tell the World bout me
Ask your girl about me, she probably tell you
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Just bought a car, the n-gga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it
He would have loved it
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down


They know I'm on a Port Arthur state of mind southern superstar status
I elevate the crime
My time is money so I put some money on my time
Lightening on the Breitling so exciting when you see that shine
We on that leather (?) before its never even thought of
I broke my bread and fed the team just like the Holy Father
I helped the blind to see and keep it G just like I oughta
The only thing thats left for us to do is walk on water
We playing all four quarters til the clock expire
So til I see the ref waving I will not retire
My flow is still official and I still got the fire
Can't take your eyes off me, like when you watch the wire
And in '0-10 we finna go in
So let the opposition know there is no win
And I am no friend so put your hand down
Tell em stand down before it's man down


Uhhh, since your telling on me
Tell the World bout me
Ask your girl about me, she probably tell you
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Just bought a car, the n-gga Pimp owned it

He would have loved it
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down


I gotta hundred girls on each phone
Drissy Drake man, young sweet Jones
I never cheat unless you count the girls I cheat on
I know you can't bring every single one you meet home
Home sick just when I thought I was sick of home
Losing track of time everyday we switching zones
Drizzy Hendrix I'm just backstage getting stoned
Thank Me Later man, a million copies shipped and gone
Overboard n-gga I'm quoting more n-gga
Results are in I guess you should have voted more n-gga
Swimming in the money y'all just float ashore n-gga
Never drowning what the f-ck you think this boat is for n-gga
Yeah I'm quick to take an RnB diva out
I'll bring some friends she'll bring some friends that know what we about
And when it's done I'll put some slippers on and see them out
And tip the driver to make sure he take the scenic route
I swear these women living like they tryna write a book after
But I'm just trying to keep it G for my chapter
Listen to my words, see just what I mean
Rest in peace to Chad Butler everyday I'm riding clean
Ohhh


Uhhh, since your telling on me

I'm so f-cking dumb I wear diamonds on my thumbs,
There's a diamond on my d-ck so theres a diamond on her tongue,
I can't feel you baby cos I romantically numb,
Emotionally drained I came here just so I can come,
Theres nothing on the God son that I haven't done,
I got a lot of problems, getting p-ssy just isn't one,
Girls are like buses every 15 mins they run,
Man they like potato chips I just cant have one,
And I might like you for a minute,
But I dont like your friends in my business,
And I feel like you don't deserve a visit,
Cos you aint in the kitchen when you want a whipping,


Uh, uh ahhhh,
I know you say you love me girrrrrrrrl,
I know you say you love me girrrrrrrrl,
Problem is you prol tell that sh-t to everybody,
So we hear you talking boo but we just dont believe you,

Uh, ok I'm all about it, all for it,
I'm all star team Jordan, small forward,
I'm never putting up a shot unless it calls for it,
No hesitation so I'm shooting if I draw for it,
How how (?) f-ck is up, now man I'm in this hoe,
Life is moving fast, where the f-ck do all these minutes go,
Mixtape dropped then I started getting 10 a show,
Now I get a hundred what the f-ck you think I'm in it for,
Young money forever, I bet Gudda, Jay and Mack agree,
F-ck you to the haters that just spend their time attacking me,
Shout out to your girlfriend n-gga lately she distracting me,
Wondering if I'm the best, Well-I-am, no Black Eyed Peas,
Girls wanna f-ck your n-ggas, guy don't wanna be you,
Lining up around the block so that they can get to see you,
I feel like I find a wife exactly when I need to,
So you can say whatever girl but we just don't believe you,


Ain't that your girl,
Aint that your money,
Aint you the same n-gga that say she want you that you funny,
Aint you a gangsta, yeah funny,
You gave em funny, gave you to you, f-cking dummy,
Classic line, b-tches run like buses,
Gucci say n-ggas asking why, why you with my girl,
She let me get it n-gga,
She aint stupid, go turn up your radio,
I'm the next young Lionel Richie,
I gives a f-ck about doing a f-cking cameo,
We don' love em, we don' love em, we don' love em, NO!
They just love us, they just love us, cos we stack them O's
Cos we whip it, watch her whip it when she whip it all
Thats gon hit, once they mention catching feelings two word don't go


Uh UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I know you say you love me girrrrrrrrrrl,
I know you say you love me girrrrrrrrrrl,
PROBLEM IS YOU PROL TELL THAT SH-T TO EVERYBODY,
SO WE HEAR YOU TALKING BOO BUT WE JUST DON'T BELIEVE YOU!!!


You know you know
You know you know

Uh, you know you know how the story goes,
You done jock my style, you done stole my flow,
You done seen me out, you gets no hello,
And you wonder why? Man you know you know,
Yeah and you should let them boys know too,
Show them n-ggas every single thing I showed you,
Im here feeling like 50 back in '02, and everybody sayin I'm the man (big mike), so true,
Yeah but what does it take to feel secure?
A place with wooden floors and space to put awards,
A couple of parking spots and maids to do the chores,
The cars you always wanted, the women that you adore,
Well I got it, I got it,
I wonder if id be happy without it, I doubt it,
I try not to really think about it,
I made it but I'm still playin like I'm bein scouted til I'm outted,
Game top bitch, I hope youre proud of us,
King james sh-t watch me throw the powder up,
This old g got my whole suite cloudin up,
But I bet you I be out of time before I'm out of luck,
They aint routin for me, they aint clappin for me,
Im only sayin can somebody just be happy for me,
I really hate to say I told you so,
So I bite my tongue but you know you know,

Uhh, please make your long story shorter,
This time is for the essence for the king of first quarter,
Numbers do the talkin I have nothing for reporters,
I just hope we make these flights and don't get held up at the border,
Yeah so you can spare me all the accolades,
Im the reason you can find my city on an atlas page,
Half a million dollars later and my taxes paid,
And I'm still spendin money from my actin days,
Damn, life is such a lovely thing,
Feel the perks that a 7 digit budget bring,
Tell your girlfriend that I can pull some f-ckin strings,
So were courtside when lebron get a f-ckin ring,
Yeah, I bet I be there I be there,
You see that '62 sittin outside? Thats me there,
Im jumpin to the top its my leap year, prepare,
Putting in that overtime I never said it be fair,
Im always left wishin I could have done it in person,
My apologies to all of the ones I was hurtin,
I got new girls but none of they love is for certain,
And call old girls but none of they numbers are workin,
Damn what happened to us?
Life can always change, you have to adjust,
How come when I got a party you stare at me in disgust?
If it is just to have fun you should see that as a plus,
Especially when I come flyin through the door
And kindly ignore the paparazzi outside and tryin to record,
Why has every woman never dined her before?
Am I the only 23 year old wine connoisseur?
The Rothschild's, the Cru's, the 'Caias and the Opuses
Its always nice when youre out with someone that notices,
My condo got that art gallery openness,
Im just really hopin that that isn't what the motive is,
They aint routin for me, they aint clappin for me,
Im only sayin can somebody just be happy for me,
I really hate to say I told you so,
So I bite my tongue but you know you know


Yeah (yeah)
Polow Da Don
Ay tell the waitress
I need a hundred bottles
(LADIES!) Where the ladies at?
Yo, a hundred bottles (ZONE 4!)

Girl, do whatever you like
It's your world, oh girl
Tonight it's on me

We in the zone, gone off Patrn
In the club, in the club, they playin her song
That's when I slowly approach you like daddy what you know
Told her girl (hold my drink) then she dropped it down low
To the flo', to the flo', she took it to the flo'
To the flo', to the flo', she took it to the flo'
Get lower baby!
To the flo', to the flo', she took it to the flo'
Oh yeah
To the flo', to the flo', she took it to the flo'
Get lower, get lower, get lower baby!

Yo, yo, yo
Ooh-wee, look how sophisticated you look in Louie
Like Judge Judy I drop a  and do your duty
Let's get some sushi, and just ski on the chatter hoochie
Stop by the crib, come watch a motherfuckin movie
I pop bottles with big girls and all the models
When we leave the party solid bookers they wanna follow
I know you got older man so tell me what I don't know
I'm in my four-do', follow me and my partner Polow
Your girls be all in your business so meet me later solo
I'll do a promo, tourin and wearin Yokomoto
I be ballin harder than motherfuckin Tony Romo
If you worry about the size girl I got a jumbo

Okay, okay, sittin in the owner's box
And in the Caribbean twistin off Corona tops
I'm sittin down hittin half-court floater shots
Bitches takin pictures because every night's a photo op
Yeah, and nothin has been photo-shopped
I say I'ma buy the bar and they say "Nigga no you're not"
I be satisfied with the percentage that my lawyer got
Makin other people rich is somethin I enjoy a lot
Uhh, can you tell even when your girl won't
I'ma still be feelin me even when the world don't
Shit just change forever, first I get a lot of dough
Then I end up with your woman, that's just how it's gotta go
Yeah, and I could tell her things to treat her right
You could get whatever baby, 'member you and me tonight
Throw the pussy at me, guarantee that you won't see the strike
I'ma hit it hard, you gon' think you Derek Jeter wife
Uhh, tell me, how does that sound?
I could get it ass up or with your back down
Spit that ahh-sookie-sookie in your ear
It's the nigga Rich Boy and the "Rookie of the Year"

Get low, g-g-go girl 
Get low get low get low get low


Uh, I am a distraction,
Comin from my spot and I dont signal as I back in.
If cash is beautiful then money is attraction
Then I should be a motherfuckin' centerfold of maxim.
Open to my page and admire my desire,
Frequent flyer I aspire to retire,
My boy stands alone if I'm with the chior,
Got a Cannon on my hip but nigga this is not Mariah.
Na, this the record killer for hire.
I eat and sleep with the weapon, the beat is all I require,
Look I created despite the nigga that hated, every single bar gettin first forty-eighted
In the state of euphoria feelin so sedated.
The me and bitch the same were feel so related,
(?) in stated or denniscaded (?)
I put a thousand on it, I could prolly fuck the waitress.
So wait just take this,
One lie at a time, make sure it makes sense
White cup, orange pop tenneshee state shit
Drop a four winning and then appreciate The Greatness, nigga haha

Yeah,
I wrote this verse sittin in my new car,
Sometimes where you headed is too far,
It's more about where you are.
And I am, everywhere where you wish you could be
Somebody somewhere just really understood me
Yeah, I dream big, no false hope
My other niggas move keys, no off notes
But understand rich is a how were all ending up,
I'm at the label in the elevator,
Send them up!


How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
Cause you know I'm okay
Instead, I ask myself, "Why do you worry?"
When you know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

I think I killed everybody in the game last year, man
Fuck it, I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club (mm-mm)
Fuck it, I was wrong though
Shout out to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes I'm about to take the hint from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field, nigga
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again?
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine
And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
Yeah...It's been that way from the beginning
I just been playing, I ain't even notice I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

Oh, I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

You say I'm old news, well who the new star?
Cause if I'm going anywhere, it's probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the States
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas that's doing dead time
Shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart, boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy
Oh, you wanna be a motherfucking funny guy?
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart, boy
Yeah.. it's whatever
You know, feeling good - living better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back paving the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with
Feel like I've been here before, huh?
I still got 10 years to go, huh?
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right

Oh, I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

Three in the morning still going down


I can see it in your eyes, you're angry
Regret got shit on what you're feelin' now
Mad cause he ain't like me
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take
All the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it
Alisha, Catya, I know that you gon' hear this
I'm the man, yeah I said it
Bitch, I'm the man, don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in your speaker right now that's me
That's me, and the voice in your ear
That's me, can't you see
That I made it? Yeah, I made it
First I made you who you are and then I made it
And you're wasted with your latest
Yeah, I'm the reason why you always getting faded

Take a shot for me, oh oh oh oh
Take a shot for me, oh oh oh oh
Take a shot for me
A shot for me oooooo
A shot for me oooo

Ok, look, I'm honest. Girl, I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I'd commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believed in everything but me, girl, I don't get you
She says "I know you changed
I never see you cause you're always busy doing things"
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place: not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And all your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all the images of your "Mr. Perfect"
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Prayin' for your happiness, hope that you recover
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it

Take a shot for me, oh oh oh oh
Take a shot for me, oh oh oh oh
Take a shot for me
A shot for me oooooo
A shot for me oooo

May your neighbors respect you
Trouble neglect you
Angels protect you
And heaven accept you


I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearing the consequence
Drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long I'm floating in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh I needed that
And they wanna see me pick back up, well where'd I leave it at
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, 'cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it, (aye) please don't do it, (aye) 'cause one of us goes in
And we all go through it (aye)
And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know

They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah they know yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave them a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know,

Yeah, I be yelling out, "Money over everything, money on my mind!"
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says they missed the old Drake, girl don't tempt me
If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do
I'm like "Why I gotta be all that?" but still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listen to you expressing all them feelings
Soap opera rappers all these niggas sound like All My Children
And that's who you thinking is 'bout to come and make a killing
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions.
You know that they ain't even got it like that.
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
'Cause I live for this it isn't just a hobby like that.
When they get my shit and play it, I ain't even gotta say it, they know

They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah they know yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave them a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know,

I be yelling out, "Money over everything, money on my mind (mind, mind, mind)!"
Tell 'em I apologize it happened over time (time, time, time)
They know


Listen, listen, whoa, yeah, listen, ooooh
Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
Theres a room full of niggas!
What you following me for?
This aint no fucking sing-along
So girl, what you singing for?
Its cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
20, keep the bar rolling
Fake IDs and the trash we going straight to the top
Rooftop closed with a handful of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowing
Light skinned chick first flight from Poland
A whole lot of friends first flight from Poland
A whole lot of cash first trip from Poland

Why? Cause they loving the crew, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
Oooooh,

Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess well never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who Im becoming
Theres times where I might do it just to do it
Like its nothing
Theres times when I might blow like 50k on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones thatll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story, it made his story
Tell em I'mma need reservations for 20
Ive never really been one for the preservation of money
Nah, I much rather spend it all while Im breathing
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know

They lovin' the crew
Oh, they lovin' the crew
Oh, they lovin' the crew
They lovin' the crew
Ohhh, oh they lovin' the crew
They lovin' the crew
They lovin' the crew
They lovin' the crew
Whoa
Cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4

If we broadcast swag,
Nigga we the news in the city


I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change
And I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours we both know
We know, they don't get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case
Big girls all get a little taste,ah
Pushing me away so I give her space,ah
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Trying to run from that, say you're done with that
On your face girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry,
You won't ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes

'Cause if you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

Yeah
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
'Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do (you do)
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
We know, you hate being alone
You ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somethin' to save you
Instead they say,
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true

Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true

I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost


"Hello.
Yeah I just walked in.
Yeah I'm good you still working?
Tonight, right now?
Did I go out? Yeah, I went out.
I went, I went to a couple of clubs.
I never went to bed.
Shit wine or water.
Just to thinking about a cold drink?
I don't know, I'm delirious night."

Cups of the Ros
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy

But I've been drinking so much
That I'mma call her anyway and say,
"Fuck that nigga that you love so bad.
I know you still think about the times we had."
I say, "Fuck that nigga that you think you found.
And since you picked up I know he's not around."

(Are you drunk right now?)

I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What you doing that's so important?
I've been drinking so much
That I'mma call you anyway and say,

"Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had."
I say, "Fuck that nigga that you think you found.
And since you picked up I know he's not around."

(Are you drunk right now?)

I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sitting talkin' 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious
of making monsters
Outta the women I sponsor
'til it all goes bad
But shit it's all good
We threw a party, yeah we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling 'cause they were just leaving
Talk to me please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while girl they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week, I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy girl
I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on

"Well, I'm sorry."
"Are you drunk right now?"

I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

"You're not gon' come?"
"Guess I'm 'bout to just kick it here then"

Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said, "You niggas crazy."
I hope no-one heard that
I hope no-one heard that
'Cause if they did, we gon' be in some trouble
If they did, we gon' be in some trouble, trouble


Looking in the mirror Im embarrassed
Im feeling like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
Im in the matter of man arm wrestling hands
I was dope when I said the music business was all I needed
When I got it I was greeted by an alien
That said last year that she slept with a Canadian
That gave him an addiction
That'd keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend
My vice is similar women love when youre my type
And you win it from everything that your palm write
Put her in the Palms Hotel, Sin City
Devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel
Live the ambiance all cause the audience
One day said I would do it
So instead of a verse being read
Ima go n get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch your ass too fat
Capitalize that, and you weave look good
With the Indian tracks
Tracking device on your used 5 series
I dont call back just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say were in the area cruisin in Toronto
Hit me on the cellular, thought he was gonna sell me a false word
Like the rappers I know
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you cant see us
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black Maybach 40 pulled up G
No doors all that nigga was missing was Aaliyah
Felt like the initiation
A reality living in the matrix
We talk casually about the industry
And how the women be the tastemakers for the shit we makin
Then he said that he was the same age as myself
And it didnt help cuz it made me even more rude and impatient
So blame it on Mr OVOXO, the reason why Im breathing on the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason was the highlight was when he said
You belong to the people when you outside
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy, full of fame
And bury yourself alive, then I died


Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn't be driving, it just got so much harder
Can't even see straight, I can't even see straight
Oh, fuck with me, I buy the shots
Live a little, cause niggas die a lot, and lie a lot
But I'm the truth that's right I fucking said it
The living proof that you ain't gotta die to get to heaven
You girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit
How'd I know, how'd I know? Thats me on some psychic shit
I can tell a lie if you asking me my whereabouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rappin', bitches, rappin', bitches bitches
And rappin' rappin' and bitches until all of it switches
I swear, it's been two years since somebody ask me who I was
I'm the greatest man I said that before I knew I was
That's what's important and what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing "walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, ah"
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways

People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love it
Nigga, do it for the city, cause you know the city love it
Nigga, do it for the city, cause you know the city love it
Nigga, do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas)

Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper that's gon' tell me that she don't dance
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all them good things, that's all I'm really good for
Memphis Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back
And Ridgecrest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth
And they rockin' furs like it's snowing in the south
And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like
So why am I in class if this is who I'm trying to be like
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
Soon as I realized that turning papers in won't get me paid
And if I don't nothing I'ma ball
I'm countin' all day like a clock on the wall
Yeah I need that, making major changes to the life I'm living
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decision
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways

People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love it
Nigga, do it for the city, cause you know the city love it
Nigga, do it for the city, cause you know the city love it
Nigga, do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas)


Yeah, never thoughts of suicide, I'm too alive
But I still treat it likes it's do or die
Even though dying isn't in the plans,
But neither was making it and here I am
In the presidential do you like your new room?
Always presidential and tonight's no blue moon
Since I saw Aaliyah's precious life go too soon,
She deserve the credit for how I'm about to get it
That's why I got a new dumb thing moving through the street
Got a new condo, move it to the beach
Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib
Goddamn man she's beauty and the beast (Lord)
Seems like yesterday that I was up and coming
Still so young that I ain't had enough of nothing

The fam here, the drink here, the girls here?
Well fuck let's get it then

I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double?
You ain't even gotta ask, ah
Because it's hard to say no, say no
Yeah it's hard to say no

Are you down, are you down? Yea you all the way down, every time
Am I down, am I down? Yea I'm all the way down, we'll be fine
Are you down, are you down? Yea you all the way down, every time
Am I down, am I down? Yea I'm all the way down, we'll be fine

Used to make us proud we had dreams of getting bigger man
Loved you until now, but now I'm the nigga man
You keep talking that "You was this and you had this
And you deserve some fucking credit how did anyone forget it."
Got a show up in your city, yo girl is in the line
And the line around the corner it's my motherfucking time
You should take it as a sign, man I got it right now.
I wouldn't doubt it cause these bitches all about it right now
Let's be real about this shit, can I take you home?
Or come to where you stay? Do you live on your own?
I heard you got your ways, I never would have known
She said "you're such a dog" I said "you're such a bone."
I've been everywhere, where you know me from?
These days women give it to me like they owe me one
But they crave attention though they always saying "Show me something."
But girl you ain't the only one that's trying to be the only one
At least I admit that, if you get that, and you with that
Then fuck let's get it then

I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double?
You ain't even gotta ask, ah
Because it's hard to say no, say no
Yeah it's hard to say no

Are you down, are you down? Yea you all the way down, every time
Am I down, am I down? Yea I'm all the way down, we'll be fine
Are you down, are you down? Yea you all the way down, every time
Am I down, am I down? Yea I'm all the way down, we'll be fine

Yeah, Drizzy. Yo turn nigga!
Take care of the business nigga (shine on these niggas)
Give these niggas the business nigga!
Kill spray anything in the way. nigga, fuck em! We don't love em!
Yeah, it's just that uptown gangsta shit
Toronto, stand up for one of the realest niggas, Drizzy, with the realest flow
Toast to this gangsta shit. OVO-YMCMB
You understand me?
Playing with these motherfucking millions like they ain't nothing
Rubber band stacks. That YMCMB shit nigga. Flashy lifestyle
One hundred


I like a woman with a future and a past
A little attitude problem all good it'll make the shit last
Don't make it too easy girl, don't take it too fast
Yeah, that's it, right there, that's it
Do it just like that
Only you could do it just like that
And I love it when your hair's still wet
'Cause you just took a shower
Running on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sounds so smart, like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale, but you probably went to Howard
Knowing you, weekend in Miami, tryna study by the pool
Couple things due, but you always get it done
Might have been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away, you always be the one
One, I wonder why the moon looks nice girl
Maybe it's just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong girl
They want you in their life as a wife
That's why you wanna have no sex
Why you wanna protest, why you wanna fight for your right
'Cause you don't love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise

I know things get hard
But girl you got it, girl you got it there you go
Can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine,
When all these motherfuckers wanna waste your time
It's just amazing, girl, and all I can say is...

I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so,
I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so,
I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so,
I'm so proud of you
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you...

B-b-b-bet I am
All of them bitches I'm badder than
Mansions in Malibu Babylon
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when I'm straddlin'
And my shit's so wet you gotta paddle in
Gotta ro-ro-row, gotta row ya boat
It's Pink Friday records and OVO
Done did the pop tour, I'm the realest still,
The best legal team so the deals is ill
It's Mac, OPI and a fragrance too
Apparel, I'm dominating every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
'Cause I'm fli-fli-fly, I'm flying high
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye bitch

But baby if you ask me to take a break
I'll give it all away, don't care what the people say
I'll be a million, billion, trillion miles away

He asked my sign, I said a Sag'
I'm a star, Sheriff badge,
What's the point? If I'm guardin'
Double D up hoes, Dolly Parton

I know things get hard
But girl you got it, girl you got it there you go
Can't you tell by how they're looking at you everywhere you go
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine, when all these motherfuckers wanna waste your time
It's just amazing, girl, and all I can say is...

I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so,
I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so,
I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so,
I'm so proud of you
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you know you are

And all I can say is
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so,
I'm so proud of you
And all I can say is
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so.
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so,
I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so,
I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so,
I'm so proud of you
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you know you are


All we wanted was opportunity
Just Blaze, Lord Knows!

Its your worst nightmare, its my first night here
And this girl right here, who knows what she knows?
So Im going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
And her purse right there, I dont trust these hoes at all
But thats just the result of me paying attention
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions
Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
Even a couple pornstars that Im ashamed to mention
But Weezy and Stunna are my only role models
Heffer and Jordan are my only role models
Thats why I walk around with all this gold on
And every time I run into these niggas they want no problems
Buy them sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings
All of the little accents that make me a king
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me
But its whatever if somebody wan make it a thing
Im more concerned what niggas thinkin about Christmas in August
Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
Get some shake a brick in the press
And chef it like Mrs. Fields theyre making the cookie stretch
I know it so well, I know the hustle so well
Stunt like Im workin overnighters right by the motel
Drug money, outfit record clean
Spend it all on me and my fuckin team
Matchin Rollies for real, matchin Rovers for real
Places they say theyve been, weve actually going for real
Im really killin shit, fuck all the jiggy rappin
Im going trigga happy just to see my niggas happy
Mixtape legend, underground kings
Lookin for the right way to do the wrong things
With my new bitch thats living in Palm Springs
Young ass nigga, lifelong dreams
They take the greats from the past and compare us
I wonder if theyd ever survive in this era
In a time where its recreation
To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations
I know of all the things that I hear they be pokin fun at
Never the flow though, they know I run that
Fuck you all, I claim that whenever
I change rap forever, the game back together, yup
YM, I remain that forever
In the same place my brother Wayne that forever
Im a descendent of either Marley or Hendrix
I havent figured it out cause my story is far from finished
Im hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me
I know that showin emotion dont ever mean Im a pussy
Know that I dont make music for niggas who dont get pussy
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me
Lord knows, Lord knows, Im heavy, I got my weight up
Roll this and boost your rate up, its time that somebody paid up
A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up
But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?
Bought a white Ghost, now shit is gettin spooky
Very, very scary, like shit you see in the movies
In this bitch all drinks on the house like Snoopy
Thats why all the real soldiers salute me
Trill nigga, for real

You know I love this
YOLO, You Only Live Once
Im going so hard my nigga, I swear homie
Everyday is another opportunity to reach that goal

I fell in love with the pen, started fucking in ink
The hustles an art, I paint it what I would think
Still allergic to broke, prescription straight to the paper
Destined for greatness, but got a place in Jamaica
Villa on the water with the wonderful views
Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews
Went and got a yacht, Im talkin Carnival cruise
And these niggas talkin like hoes, they mad they not in my shoes
Its the red bottom boss, came to buy the bar
Every by week, shit, Im bound to buy a car
Murder-cedes Benz of that bubble double R
Headlights flickin, lookin like a fallin star
Everyday them hammers bang, whippin' yay like Anna Mae
I run the game but the ladies think Im running game
Mink coats making women wanna fornicate
Rosay and Drake, Im gettin cake, nothin short of great


Word on road is the clique about to blow
You ain't gotta run and tell nobody they already know
We've been living on a high, they've been talking on a low
But it's cool, know you heard it all before

That's why I asked you how you mean, how you mean?
Thought you knew about the team
That's why I asked you how you mean, how you mean?
Thought you knew about the team

How you mean, how you mean, what you know about the team
Man these niggas need to stop it they be crowding up the scene
Baby girl you need to stop it all that pride and self esteem
Got you angry about this girl I'm with in all them magazines

Baby she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It look like we in love, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera

Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know I could be your knight in shining Armor All tires
Trying to tell you I'm the one, come and holla at me
Before I'm on the next thing, YMCMB

Ooh finally got you right here
(Said I finally got my baby)
Tonight I'll ease your mind
(Tonight I'll ease your mind)
That's why I'm calling on you
(Why I'm calling on you)

And ooh soft your loves desire
(Soft your love)
It's hard to stay away
You keep me calling on you
(Oh girl, you keep me calling on you)
(Oh girl, you keep me calling on you)

How you mean, how you mean
Thought you knew about the team
How you mean, how you mean
Thought you knew about the team

How you mean, how you mean, what you know about the team
You just know what you get told girl I see behind the scene
She spilled whiskey on her shirt, she gonna have to get it cleaned
She been going way too hard, someone has to intervene

Baby she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It might look like I care, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera

Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know I could be your knight in shining armor all tires
Girl they love me like I'm Prince, like the new kid with the crown
Bunch of underground kings, thought you knew how we get down

Ooh finally got you right here
(Said I finally got my baby)
Tonight I'll ease your mind
(Tonight I'll ease your mind)
That's why I'm calling on you
(Why I'm calling on you)

And ooh soft your loves desire
(Soft your love)
It's hard to stay away
(Stay away)
You keep me calling on you
(Oh, girl you keep me calling on you)

How you mean, how you mean, thought you knew about the team
How you mean, how you mean, thought you knew about the team

Just mail me my ring back, can't keep that shit


Oh yeah

Summer's mine
I swear I said about a hundred times, I'ma need it back
I wish that you would come and find me
Just to tell me that I haven't changed, girl I needed that from you
I'm getting money just taking care of me girl
I'm spending time just taking care of me right now
I'm getting money just taking care of me girl
Cuz you'd be tired of taking care of me by now

But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
So you should go
You should go, before you stay too long

Don't you go getting married, don't you go get engaged
I know you're getting older, don't have no time to waste
I shouldn't be much longer but you shouldn't have to wait
Can't lose you, can't help it, I'm so sorry, I'm so selfish
Uh, uh, I've been chilling in the city where the money's thrown high and the girls get down
In case you starting to wonder why my new shit's sounding so H-town
But when it's all done baby I'm yours if you're still around
She knows, she knows, she knows

But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
So you should go
You should go, before you stay too long


When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world, that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too

But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)

We live in a generation of, not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too

But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)


People around you should really have nothing to say
Me, Im just proud of the fact that youve done it your way
And the weekends here started it right
Even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends
That you said you might bring
If theyre the ones that tell you that you do the right thing

Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down

But I gotta say, oh babe, oh babe, why is this so familiar?
Just met, already feel like I know the real her
You mustve done this before, this cant be your first time
We mustve been here before, its still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but wont find
You mustve done this before, this cant be your first time

They keep telling me dont save you
If I ignore all that advice
Then something isnt right
Then who will I complain to?
But the weekends here started it right
Even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too. Theres things we might discover
Cause you got a past and I do too, were perfect for each other

Cause to her Im just a rapper, and soon shell have met another
So if tonights an accident, tomorrow well recover
And I know Im not supposed to judge a book by its cover
I dont wanna be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder
About her, and she with it if Im with it, and Im with it
I know what makes her smile, but I wont know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
I know this aint your first, but its better than your last.
Tunechi

Shower her with dollar tips
Shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name
You throw that ho a scholarship
All of them ain't all equipped
And this saddens me, I see the pecking order
Quote-unquote "bad bitches" work the whole floor
Those that get laughed at sit off in the corner
Like a lab rat nobody want her
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home
But we look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim
We lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colorblind
Cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in the Boise state
Can't see her play or the team, cuz
Everybody has an addiction; mine happens to be you
And those who say they don't
Souls will later on say to them "that ain't true"
All of them will have an opinion
But y'all know what you can do with them
But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
To a place you can stick that in
Well, sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele, I feel you baby
Someone like you, more like someone unlike you
Or something that's familiar maybe
And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell "girl that you're crazy!"
Oh what the hell? Nope can't be lazy
Please be careful: bitches got the rabies


(Gotta do what I gotta do, yeah)
All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where-
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only 'hello' or 'happy belated'
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love it
Then right after texted and told her I'm faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives can make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking with ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions
Like:

Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit' you?

And I say
Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right

So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met, later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive, and she was sober
I gave her pills
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me, asking for closure
Damn
She say this shit gon' catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like

Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit' you?

(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Damn right, all right

(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Damn right, all right
Awww... Yeah


It's like '09 in your basement and I'm in love with Nebby
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn't ready
And your back hurt, and your neck hurt, and you smoking heavy
And I sit next to you, and I lecture you because those are deadly
And then you ash it and we argue about spending money on bullshit
And you tell me I'm just like my father, my one button, you push it
Now it's "Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat"
And I leave out and you call me, and you tell me that you're sorry
You love me, and I love you, and your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep but it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter, I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard
If you were healthy and it weren't so bad
Uh, maybe I should walk up the street, and try and get a job at the bank
'Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks, we'll probably end up robbing a bank
Then Wayne calls on my phone, conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinking of signing me, I come home
We make a mixtape with seventeen songs
and almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son man that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
I get to make good on my promise
It all worked out girl, we shoulda known
'Cause you deserve it

Is this shit real, should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be some
When you stressed out, and you need some, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

It's like '06 in your backyard and I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love, 'cause when it's that real, it's when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid
Damn, boo-hoo, sad story, black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid but
That still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you man this all new shit
Made the world I know bigger, changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib
You'd calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting, now I'm more in touch with the music
You said either way I'll be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, you got to me
Then you tossed the keys and loaned me your car
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop-top Lexus
Hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid that's goin' through life
So worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that, they said no, we went back
Checks bounce but we bounce back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where I'd really be without that,
It worked out man, you deserve it

Is this shit real, should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be some
When you stressed out, and you need some, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

Hi, Aubrey, I'm here sitting with my son having a little talk, and he knows how to get in touch with you now to let you know how grateful I am for your help in keeping me in this, in this comfortable place.
All I can say, Aubrey, is I remember the good times we had together and the times I used to look after you.
And I still have wonderful feelings about that.
So, God bless you, and I hope I'll see you.


Cash-money shit.
Cash-money shit.

I can tell that money's got you working.
We've been talking for so long.
Now we're finally here in person.
I taste pain and regret
In your sweat.
You've been waiting for me. Oh, ho.

I can tell that you've been practicing.
I can tell that you've been practicing.
All those other men were practice, they were practice,
Yeah, for me, for me, for me, for me.

Money flipper. Yeah
Get it understood. Yeah.

Girl, I know what's real
'Cause I've been around it.
You only want what's real,
You just never found it.

Don't give them no more chances.
Ooh, girl, they had their turn.
Everything for a reason.
There's things you had to learn
From them.
But when I get you to myself,
You know what's going down, what's going down.

Girl, you look good.
Won't you back that ass up?
You're a fine motherfucker.
Won't you back that ass up
Call me "big daddy".

But let a real nigga make it right.
Let a real nigga make it right.
You deserve that much.
Let me put something in your life.
Let me put something in your life,
Put something in your life.

You're telling me
It's only been a couple other people
That you've been with.
I'm 'a trust you.
I'm 'a give you the benefit of the doubt,
And I'm 'a love you.
You can even call me "daddy",
Give you someone to look up to

All my girls from the 504

After you back it up, then stop.
After you back it up, then stop.
Baby girl, after you back it up, then stop.
Yeah, after you back it up, then stop.

I can tell that money's got you working,
That your body's so wet,
And we're finally here in person.
I taste pain and regret
In your sweat.
You've been waiting for me. Oh, ho.

I can tell that you've been practicing.
I can tell that you've been practicing.
All those other men were practice, they were practice,
Yeah, for me, for me, for me, for me.


I hate when people say they feel me man, I hate that shit.
Itll be a long time before yall feel me, if ever

You wont feel me til everybody say they love you, but its not love
And your suit is Oxblood and your girl fuckin hates you and your friends faded off shots of
What you ordered than forget about the game you on top of
Your famous girlfriend ass gettin thicker than the plot does
And when you forget it, thats when she pop up
And you got a drop but you ride around with the top up
I get 3 SUVs for niggas dressed like refugees
And deal with the questions about all your excessive needs
And you do dinners at French Laundry and Napa Valley
Scallops and glasses of Dolce, that shit right up your alley
You see a girl and you ask about her
Bitches smiling at ya, it must be happy hour
They put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down
Its feeling like you own every place you choosing to be at now
Walking through airport security with your hat down
Stead of gettin a pat down, they just keep on saying that they feel ya nigga

Yeah,
Its been too long
Been way too long

Im faded too long, oooh
Still Im Faded too long, ooooh
Still Ive been faded too long
I been faded too long
The ride

You wont feel me til you want it so bad you tell yourself youre in it
And tell the World around you that your paper work is finished
And steal your mothers debit cards so you maintain an image
And ride around in overpriced rental cars that ain't tinted
You need a minute, you got it
You know its real when your latest nights are your greatest nights
The sun is up when you get home, that's just a way of life
Apartment 1503, some couches and paintings
When you record with 2 others that want the same things
Yeah, it start to feel better than home feels
And so you up there every night you swear you getting close
That champagne money was for gas and phone bills
But shit you bout to spend it on what matters most
You drop a couple songs and hopes that you can beat a nigga
And come out every night to let the city see the nigga
Telling stories that nobody relate to
And even though they hate you they just keep on telling you they feel ya nigga

I havent been inside terminal 1 and 3 in so long
Im driving right up to it now, make sure you got your coat on
That runway can be cold especially after summers rolled on
And all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs
Performance out the years, got you asking whats good at home
Whats good at home?
The same hoes are still at it, I shoulda known
My young niggas poppin Ms and sippin dirty jones
Problem children that all be reppin Octobers Own
Brand new girl, and she still growing
Brand new titties, stitches still showing
Yeah and she just praying that it heals good
Im bout to fuck and Im just praying that it feels good
I really dont know much but shit I know a secret
They say more money more problems, my nigga dont believe it
I mean sure theres some bills and taxes Im still evading
But I blew 6 million on my self and I feel amazing
Young money maker, season ticket holder
Season switching over
I come through them bitches still scorching as if I didnt notice
You niggas gettin older, I see no threat in Yoda
Im out here messing over the lives of these niggas
that couldnt fuck with my freshman flow
Look at that fucking chip on your nephews shoulder
My sophomore they was all for it, they all saw it
My Juniors and senior will only get meaner
Take Care nigga


She says "kiss me like you miss me, fuck me like you hate me
And when you're fucking someone else just fuck her like she ain't me"
Damn, those words are scary, those words are scary virgin Mary
I just tell her to spare me
I was in love 2 years ago and gave the baggage to my ex
It's all for her to carry, bags she deserve to carry
I hate that ho, I make it so hard just to talk, don't I?
I get off topic don't I? I get it poppin' don't I?
I'll end up stopping won't I? And by the time I end up stopping
You'll be rocking one of the rings you pointed out while shopping with a nigga don't lie
She's losing it right now, cause if I wasn't who I am, she would've been moving in by now
But instead we're moving slow -- I guess she's used to it by now
And she gives me all her trust and I'm abusing it right now
But this money coming in is just confusing shit right now
You just told me I ain't shit and I guess I'm proving it right now

I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'mma call somebody up and see if they be down
Cause I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
So she's here and we're both so gone

Hotel to hotel, girl - I could use your company
Full name and birthday, I book a flight, you come to me
But she don't want a weekend - she wants all of me or none of me
If she can't work with all of me then she say she done with me
You say that you over me you always end up under me
You know how it goes - don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me
Don't start with yo shit - I put you back in your place
She tells me "I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face"
And hang up yeah, how dare you tell me it's tougher for you
Like I don't hear about the niggas you fucking with, too
And whoever I be with, they got nothing on you
That's just something to do when there's nothing to do
Yeah, but she's losing it right now
She has choices she should make I think she's choosing it right now
One more chance to make it right, I think I'm using it right now
You just said I never learn I guess I'm proving it right now

I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'mma call somebody up and see if they be down
Cause I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
So she's here and we're both so gone


I'm the fuckin' man, you don't get it do ya?
Type of money everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City bitch
Some Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami too
Clubbing hard, fuckin' women there ain't much to do

Wrist blang, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel? how you feel? how you feel?
Twenty five sittin' on 25 mil uh
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'mma do it for the Bay, okay
Getting paid we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune "light one, pass it like a relay"
YMCMB you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, Marley Marl at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shout to Gibbo
We got Santa Margarita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
Aoh, that's how you feel man?
That's really how you feel?
'Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't
Then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal,
Real nigga what's up?

Now she want a photo
You already know though
You only live once: that's the motto nigga YOLO and
We bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way
Real nigga what's up?

One, time fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven, grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO add a B to that shit
I'm fucked-up, tore-down
I'm twisted: door knob
Talk stupid, off with your head!
Nigga money talks and Mr Ed! Yea!
I'm so Young Money got a drum on the gun
Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi

Now she want a photo
You already know though
You only live once: that's the motto nigga YOLO and
We bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sitting on the bench, nigga we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way
Real nigga what's up

T Raw, skinny nigga big balls
Fuck around get dragged, Ru Paul
You a funny little nigga, Duval
Out of this world, Total Recall
Call a bitch raw dick let her see-saw
Sorta like a donkey like an ass nigga he-haw
Riding round in the 'rari with the top off
While you in the window man I'm probably on my next car
Ay! Mighty duck with the ice on
Real L.A. nigga trucks with the gun drawn
Drawing on your face you a clown jack in the box
Boy that's your bop she my new poom poom star
Stars in the back and my homies they don't act
Acting brand new fuck her never call her back
Matt Forte got the bitch running back
Man that's the motto you ain't know it's like that?

Now she want a photo
You already know though
You only live once: that's the motto nigga YOLO and
We bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sitting on the bench, nigga we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way
Real nigga what's up what's up what's up
Real nigga what's up what's up what's up
Real nigga what's up what's up what's up


Comin' off the last record, I'm gettin' 20 million off the record
Just to off these records, nigga that's a record
I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure
Past the present when you have to mention
This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though
Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus
We keep it thorough, nigga, rap like this for all of my borough niggas
I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga
Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga
I could go a hour on this beat, nigga
I'm just as famous as my mentor
But that's still the boss, don't get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for
Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more
Hot temper, scary outcome
Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one
That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it
Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it
Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smelling like a brick
Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit
Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich
Self explanatory, you just here to spread the story, wassup

Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV
Young rebel, Young Money nothin' you could tell me
Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me
I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family
Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'
I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it
I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it
Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'
On a mission tryna shift the culture
Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit
Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
Like aye, B I got your CD, you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
I don't change like credentials, you know you see the necklace
My life's a completed checklist
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now
Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now
That's real

How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote we went from Bundy to Winslow
This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna
The Fresh Prince just had dinner with Tatiana, no lie
All these 90's fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if you're fine
That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO
Wanted to tell you, "Accept yourself"
You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself
And if you end up needing some extra help, then I can help
You know, back on your feet and shit
Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorcese
And I wouldn't change a thing if you payed me, now real nigga wassup


Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between "I want it" and "I got it"
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment

But I stay down, girl, I always stay down
Get down, never lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now
So much on my plate now
People I believed in: they don't even show their face now

What they got to say now?
Nothing they can say now
Nothing really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now?
What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothing was the same

I still been drinking on the low
Mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low
Smokin' on the low
I still been plotting on the low
Scheming on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know

I just been drinkin' on the low
Mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low
Smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low
Schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know

And I hate that you don't think I belong to you
Just too busy running shit to run home to you
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations
I know I can't change what happened

I can't help it
I can't help it
I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's

Now you hate me
Stop pretending, stop that fronting
I can't take it
Girl, don't treat me like a stranger
Girl, you know I seen you naked

Girl, you know that I remember
Don't be a pretender
Getting high at the condo
That's when it all comes together

You know I stay reminiscing
And make-up sex is tradition
But you've been missing, girl
And you might feel like nothing was the same

I still been drinking on the low
Mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low
Smokin' on the low
I still been plotting on the low
Scheming on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know

I just been drinkin' on the low
Mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low
Smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low
Schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know

Drinking, smoking, fucking, plotting
Scheming, plotting, scheming, getting money
Drinking, fucking, smoking, plotting, scheming
Plotting, scheming, getting money

This the life for me
My mama told me this was right for me
I got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me

Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rapping different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slipping

Naked women swimming: that's just how I'm living
Donate a million to some children: that's just how I'm feeling
A nigga filling up arenas. Who the fuck can see us?
I had to Derrick-Rose the knee up
Before I got the re-up

Yours truly, the boy
I just build and build more
Y'all niggas build to destroy
Y'all niggas party too much
Man, I just chill and record
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't feel it before

Yes, Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to
This the shit I wanna go out to


Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fuckin' here

I done kept it real from the jump
Livin' at my mamas house, we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was tryin' to get it on my own
Workin' all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle calling me like "Where ya at?
I gave you the keys told ya bring it right back
Nigga, I just think it's funny how it goes
Now Im on the road, half a million for a show
And we...

Boys tell stories about the man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it
Nigga, I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much I hear that's poppin' off without us
Nigga, we just want the credit where it's due
Imma worry about me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when Im in the house
Cause we...

No new niggas, nigga we dont feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where're your real friends at?
We dont like to do too much explainin'
Story stays the same, I never changed it
No new niggas, nigga we dont feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where're your real friends at?
We dont like to do too much explainin'
Story stay the same through the money and the fame
Cause we...

Came in the game, went online and it changes
These fuck niggas'll say it in ten different ways
Then see you and smile in your face
You wanna meet up, name a time or a place
Im smokin' that fire, my nigga you know that its fire
You smell it as soon as I blaze
Burnin' a pound, burnin' a pound, burnin' a pound
Yeah, its goin' down, its goin' down, its goin' down
Started from the bottom now we here
Had a dream bout a car, and went and got it in a year
All black trucks when we pull up to the Lear
All black Coupe, I look like Bruce when Im steerin'
Hope the homie Drake dont get pissed
But niggas never ever put your man on songs like this
And I probably said no to it before
But I made 20 millions so we should probably go on tour
And I just seen Waka the other day
He wasnt trippin', we just talked about the money we been makin'
Cause we


I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure

How you feel about coming home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fucking out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?

Tongue kisses, stank hoes at the Coachella
Thank the Lord she never listen what a hoe tell her
Not only could I do better, but I know better
How could I ever be the king without a Coretta?
Feeling like Rae, same damn Lo sweater
MAC 10, Beretta for the cold weather
Her ex let her blow cheddar, she a go getter
Hoe, clothes fit her, more wetter, but her flow better
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Keep machine gun strapped in case a nigga wanna act up
Petite gun raps ain't even strong enough to match us
Machine gun BLAT in case a nigga wanna act tough
Ain't nothing like a bad bitch
That make a jiggy nigga wanna go and run up in that shit raw
Like Brother Man from the 5th floor
I creep up in it, deep up in it 'til she tell a nigga, It's yours
I know this shit is mine for the taking
If I ain't a Mason it's some gay shit
Prolly why I don't react when you say this shit
Half the times niggas don't even make sense
Know this shit is yours
When you do a world tour all off a mixtape shit
You know this shit is yours
When your face on every magazine cover, every page shit
You know this shit is yours
When you fuck a new different bad broad every day shit
Only get high just to compliment my maintenance
I took a little moment out to say this


Own it
It's yours 

Yours
You're still the one that I adore
Ain't much out there to have feelings for
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Yours
A few bottles on the table, a few waters
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is?
It's yours

Next time we fuck, I don't wanna fuck, I wanna make love
Next time we talk, I don't wanna just talk, I wanna trust
Next time I stand tall I want to be standing for you
And next time I spend I want it all to be for you oh oh
Peaking, I'm peaking, wake up with me this weekend, weekend no oh
Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
It's yours

Own it 
I said go own that shit
Own that shit, own that shit
Own that shit, go own that shit
Own that shit, own that shit
Own that shit, own that shit
Go own that shit

Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Just let that shit sink in
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Who could get the pussy quicker these days
Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days
Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days (trippin')
Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story
My ex-girl been searchin' for a "sorry" (and u know)
Couple bitches tryin' to have me on the Maury like nigga it's yours
You should be supportin' but where you been at? On tour, gettin' money
Y'all don't even really check for me
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me
Girl, you don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me
Girl, cause you got the Batphone in my workline
You should call
When the last time you did something for the first time?
You have done it all, I swear to God
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Got you thinkin' that I'm different these days
Broken telephone for every single conversation
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's always gonna be yours

Own it 
The shit
Own it, own it
It's yours, yeah
It's yours, own it
Own it
Own it
Own it
Own it
Baby, own it
It's yours
Own that shit, own that shit
Own that shit


Worst motherfucker never loved us
Fucker never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now
Still at it, scrub Js with a toothbrush
Shit, niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police asking us questions,
Nigga we don't know shit
Flexin', nigga I'm just flexin'
Nigga never loved us
Do it look like we stressin'?
Look at you, look at you, and look at you,
I'm glad that they chose us
Command, it's a mission,
Tryna fight to the finish
Just to see am I finished

On my worst behavior, no?
They used to never want to hear us,
Remember?
Motherfucker never loved us, remember?
Motherfucker, remember?
Motherfucker never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior,
Don't you ever get it fucked up
Motherfuckers never loved us
Man, motherfuckers never loved us

Worst behavior

Hold up, hold my phone
Motherfuckers never loved us
Fucker never loved us
Now you want to roll one
Motherfucker never loved us
So everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Motherfucker, I done grown up
You know me, you know me
I'm liable to do anything when it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch you better have my money when I come for the shit like O.D.B.

On my worst behavior, no?
They used to never want to hear us,

Worst behavior

Who's hot, who not?
Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop
Whose jewels got rocks,
Who else making rap albums doing numbers like it's pop
Same old pimp,
Drake you know ain't nothing's changed with these funny style niggas
We done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
And it's back to L.A.,
Open the mail, staring at the cheque
Enough to make you throw up
Man it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playing with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from?
I imported mine
Bar Mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 AM then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stunting, I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the border line
Hate to leave the city but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm coming back on my worst behavior

Remember?
Remember?
Motherfucker
Remember?
Hold up, hold my phone, they used to never want to hear us
Remember?
Motherfucker never loved us
Remember?
Motherfucker
Remember?
Worst behavior


What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it
You've been caught up with them bitches
I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that

'Cause I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you, what are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70s on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you, what are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

Thinkin' 'bout Texas back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she started telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in The Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without trying to prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for, who better for you than the boy, huh?

I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you, what are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

Been Baka aka Not Nice from time, G
Been a East Side ting
Scarborough ting from time, G
Been have up the ting them from time, G
So I don't know what's wrong with these
Little wasteman out here eh?
Y'all need to know yourself.


Shorty I got more money than I ever had
But you the only thing I need right now 
You make it all so simple, you my new thing
Ha Ha Ha Ha!

I fuck her like an addict, she fuck me like she mad at me
But it's all cool though, I flew out Aneisha just last week
When I'm away she send me pics in the sheets
Saw my grin on my cars on my sneaks
Wait, let me keep this shit simple
Fuck the radio this shit's a nigga tempo
Fat boy blue jeans and a gold watch
Started at the bottom then she rolled on top
Black testerosa, zero to sixty on the strip she's explosive
Just got back from Dubai, Emirates live flew in with 1.5
Never fold is the threshold, like my mother sayin now never let go
Hood nigga with a escrow, bad bitch but she special
Went home and I prayed for a angel appeared in the dark here to take away the pain too
War wombs on the big dog, but she get the ball like it's tip off
Watch D-Wade got two seats, got her everything but the blue beach
Cartier wings nigga two seats, nigga gettin money like a new Meech
We the knights of the Templar, dirty little nigga with ten cars
This whole clique another Enron, baby girl it's time for you to get gone
Here's a shoulder just to lean on, Rozay baby and the team strong

I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly

Cause you're a good girl and you know it...
You act so different around me...
Cause you're a good girl and you know it...
I know exactly who you could be...
Just hold on, we're going home...
Just hold on, we're going home...
It's hard to do these things alone...
Just hold on, we're go-ing home, ohh-ohh oh ohhhh..

"Theres 3 balls and a strike. Here's the pitch.
It's belted deep to center, Revere goes back, jumps at the wall, and it's gone!"

Isn't it amazing how you talk all this shit and we still lack communication
How beautiful our kids would be, girl, I don't need convincing
How every conversation starts with "this time will be different"
Oh, the idea is fun, oh, the idea is fun
Oh, the idea is so fun every time
At least we try for home run every time

Swanging, eyes closed just swanging
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume cause I don't respect assumptions babe
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' babe
Yeah, swanging

She just wanna run around the city and make memories
That she can barely remember
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
She just wanna run over my feelings
Like she drinking and driving in an 18 wheeler
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
She used to say: "You can be whoever you want, even yourself"
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was and never leave as myself
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground
Wish you would learn to love people and use things
And not the other way around

Swanging, eyes closed just swanging
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume cause I don't respect assumptions babe
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' babe
I'll be here,just swanging

I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is
She call and tell me be here before the sun up
I be dressed before we hung up
I take Eglinton to 401 east
And exit at Markham road in the east end
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping
My license been expired I renew it after the weekend
Fuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends
Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness
I hate stoppin' for gas this late
Cause there's niggas creepin and not like how we're creepin'
Summer is comin' know you could feel it
20 on pump whatever I ain't got enough to fill it
Won't knock on your door
My uncle say, "You drive my whip like it's yours"
I got the pedal to the floor
I'm on my motherfuckin' way swangin'

Don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'll be there just swangin'
I'll be there just swangin'
I treat you good girl like you're famous
I know I'm late it's always the same shit
But don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'm on the road right now swangin, girl


Yeah. (Young Money)
Yeah yeah.
Yeah yeah.
Yeah yeah.
Yeah yeah.
Look look.
I don't know why they been lying but yo shit is not that inspiring
Bank account statement just look like I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talkin' that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck goin' platinum, I looked at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one you should worry about
I don't know who you're referring to, who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit, man, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplaying the money but that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time putting money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour and you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the making, it's all for the city
They know I come right every summer, Cash Money Records forever
I'm always big timing, bitch, I came up right under Stunna
You know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh well
Bein' ready is real, I don't know about you
She just wanna smoke and fuck, I said, "Girl, that's all that we do."
Okay, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Bein' ready is real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said, "Girl, that's all that we do."

I'm about to roll one and light it and fuck it man, no one's invited
I gotta kill off the weak shit that's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you whylin', I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands and eat with Italians, I do
People are funny; you don't even know 'bout the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed, it could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me, just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days and she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I gotta get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
Been workin' so hard on the album I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna
You know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell

Locker room full of money, girl you just did it

Down payment on the Jaguar, your roommate got credit

Your parents sayin' this another phase in your life
They can't wait until it's all finished
Shine on them hoes, let 'em know that you run shit
I get it I get it, I'm workin' too hard let's get into some fun shit

Your momma used to live at the church on Sunday
You just go to LIV after church on Sunday
Oh Lord, oh Lord we're not in Kansas anymore
We're not in Kansas anymore


Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you

Ah. Don't think about.

Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stackin' up like I'm fund-raisin'

Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls,
And then end up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it; I just ride with it
Moment I stop havin' fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's puttin' shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it

Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summer time, I keep it 100
Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted

I was birthed there in my first year,
Man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like "Is Bun comin'?
Fuck that, is anyone comin' before I show up there and there's no one there?"
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there

Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, "Take a deep breath, you're too worried about bein' the best out"

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you

Ah. Don't think about.

Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family goin' backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'

I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like "Oh well, this is life, I guess."
Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit

Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here

I hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment,
Tellin' herself that she's too sick
To get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit

And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round
Started treatin' me like I'm "him" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now

Shit got me feelin' pinned down, pick the pen up and put the pen down
I'm writin' to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you

Don't feel like, you give up
Your heart's done
Your love's done
Don't give up
Don't fake it
Don't have to...


"Good God Almighty. Like back in the old days. You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had champagne in the studio, of course, you know, compliments of the company, and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last, all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow..."

Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money
Dollar dollar bill y'all

After hours at Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boostin' my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talkin', say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents, but thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink, I could murder word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are

Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money
Dollar dollar bill y'all

I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all-black Maybach but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my Jess
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Chang, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
'Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too
Shout out to Worldwide Wes
Everywhere we go we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feelin' us
The homie said, "Hov, it ain't many of us."
I told him, "Less is more, niggas. It's plenty of us."

Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money
Dollar dollar bill y'all

Cake, cake cake cake cake cake
500 million, I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a carrot cake
Now here's the icing on the cake
Cake, cake cake cake cake
I'm just gettin' started, oh yeah we got it bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Biggs made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans'a tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci air bag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus, grab the wheel

Look, fuck all that "Happy to be" here shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna little bro me dog
Like I should fall in line, like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy and not say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressin' different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior
And not talk my shit and do it major like the niggas who paved a way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same, man, I'm doin' it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feelI don't knowguilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
But I thought, "Fuck." It's worth it to share it with someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time. She a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her that she could live with me if she needs to.
I got a compound but I think she straight
'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me out of the back room
Where I was rapping with Jas over beats
That I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway three months later I'm his artist he probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me always couldn't believe when he called me you never know it could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti and did that shit 'cause it's something to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dog, nothing was the same, dog


We had the type of nights where morning comes too soon... and nothing was the same

Watch me, going out of the way
When I should've went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib,
Should drive by right where you live, and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, probably put me in the past
I can still get you wet and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn something

Come thru... come thru... come thru... come thru...
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do, so get your ass in that car and come thru
Come thru... come thru... come thru... come thru...
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do, so get your ass in that car and come thru

Last night I brought DOA to the studio
They already had a stage and a booty pole
Its supposed to be a lot of hard working going on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' going on
Someone put a order in for a chicken
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen
Yeah they know I got the hook-up, they just wait on me to cook up
Baby I heat up the stove, you do the dishes ya know?
Rap game, crack game, ain't that different ya know?
Last album had it booming something vicious ya know?
And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl ya know ya got that, know ya got that thing that I like
Girl you got that thing for real
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?
Who else got all the things you need at 4 AM when it's late?
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn something

Why has it been so long? Why has it been so long?
Why has it been... Why has it been...
Who you been crying to?
Who you been flying to?
Whose bed are you sleeping in?
Someone's been hiding you
Where have you been?
You deserve rounds tonight,
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Rounds tonight oh,
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight


I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free Randy

Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I 
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ringdogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, "Baby girl, fall in line"
Okay, made a million, off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested (Tru)

Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I 
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
'Cause myself just told myself
"You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help"
Cashing checks and I'm bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking 'bout who next, but I'm about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I'm the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'mma make it last forever
It's not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I'm on the road box office sales
I'm getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
'Cause if we judging off your advances
Then I just got paid like eight advances, God damn

Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I 
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me

Ho, shut the fuck up
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everythingeverything but gentle
But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch

Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year
I'll do King of Diamonds 3 more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section
Like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way
Sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that
They ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine
I let you eat like that
I been taught to never loan somebody
What you need right back
And I need that shit right back
(No more free Randy) I'm blessed than a muhfucka
Niggas been stressed than a muhfucka
Niggas getting nervous
Clutching they chests like a muhfucka
Damn that's a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don't listen to you
'Cause I don't like being lied to
And that ship won't sail
And that wind won't guide you
Daddy was in jail, we was talking through the window
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then, man
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do


It's not me and you
It's not me. It's you
You're reckless and you know it
They don't love you like I do
Say you're moving on, well, I guess that's just the motion

I guess that's just the motion (oooh) 

I don't have a fuck to give
I been moving state to state
In my leather and my Tims
Like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chubb
That's my nigga from the way
On the East side of the city
That's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling
'Cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it
I can never do no wrong
When they need a favor from ya man they don't leave you alone

But, I guess that's just the motion
And their phone doesn't ring when they got everything
That's the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (oooh) 

Yeah,
Looking back on it at least my pride is in tact
'Cause we said no strings attached
And I still got tied up in that
Every thing that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her
And she know it
The girl that I want to save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that want to be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help

But, I guess that's just the motion
Yeah, she'll probably come around soon as I settle down
That's the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (ooh) 

Nothing less and nothing more
I hear your heart hit the floor
(I guess that's just the motion)
Talking to you's not enough (no ohh)

I guess that's just the motion (ohh)
I guess that's just the motion

Got girls here going way way way way way way
Sauga city trip the pay day
Glo'd up off a gate way, man, you can't afford me
Doing is one thing, doing it right is a whole different story
Niggas is all in their feelings these days
All in their feelings these days
But hearing the scripture with that many sixes
You should be afraid


Been a minute since we've slept together
Finna get myself together
I've been thinkin' about everything
I don't know if it's because I'm lonely
Lonely on a Wednesday night
Girl I'm lonely
I'll admit it if you just keep quiet
Girl I'm lonely
That shit ain't my fault girl
Cause I'm lonely
Name another woman, ain't no other woman that should come for me
When I'm lonely
Mix the Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When I'm lonely, when I'm lonely

Heard you spend your summers in Miami
At somebody's house
That you didn't buy
You're young so have fun girl
I hope it's worth it
Cause fuck it I'm not here to judge
Fuck it I'm not here to love
Everything you did to ball
Fuck it, I'm just glad you called
Ring ring ring, what a thing
Ring ring ring, school bell I ring
You and I got options bae
But name another woman
Ain't no other woman that should come for me when I'm lonely
When I'm lonely
Mix the Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When I'm lonely, when I'm lonely
This shit ain't my fault


Boys, now listen, we got more motherfuckin' TV screens
On the outside the damn tour bus than on that motherfucker. Boys playin' Playstation
We come through motherfuckin' hang gliding
Off motherfuckin' Versace skyscrapers
I don't get it, what more can you ask for?

Yeah, sound sound sound
Real 6 side shit
Sickos, ah man

Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin' it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'mma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo
I ain't tryna chance it
I be with the bands like a nigga went to Jackson State
Or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it

I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to man

Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'
You don't understand, I'm the only one to hear from
You don't understand that it's me or nothin'
Yea, I'm fuckin' glowin' up
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
Real quick man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real nigga, you couldn't have made it that
Woah, dance our dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we bout to land I can call to tell the wolves I'm home now
I'll tell 'em link up at the valley at the Hazy
Think I had the shit that had the city going crazy

When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy do I smell beef? Mmmm pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five but still remember the drought in '87
Lord tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over Pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll bitch

Let's just let bygones be bygones, okay?
Let's just go ahead and just let bygones be bygones
I pull up lookin' like a damn cyborg, weighin' 224
Oh man, these boys don't even understand
Listen when you see OVO Jodi pull up on the scene with Drake
For goodness sakes, well for goodness sakes
You see this mixtape you listenin' to? This an album
Yea, we could have, we could have sold it to you for 17.99
Or 29.99 with the shirt, buy it at the Target
These motherfuckers trippin' so hard I had to look down and double check cause I thought they had their shoes tied together
Motherfuckers got they shoes tied together
What more could you ask for?
Boys harassing me with these questions
How about this?
How about don't ask me no more motherfucking questions
We ain't doing no interview


Boomin' out in South Gwinnett like Lou Will
6 man like Lou Will, 2 girls and they get along like I'm...

No ho shit, no fuckin' ho shit, save that for your shit

I told yah, thought I told yah, you didn't listen
Fieri, I'm in the kitchen, I'm a magician
I'm on it, I'm like Macgyver, I'm Michael Meyers
I kill careers and cut the lights off, this shit is frightenin'
I knew it would end up like this, I'm fuckin' psychic
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift

(Yeah) Work the night shift
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
Work, work the night shift

Young but I'm gettin' every single motherfuckin' thing
I'm owed, you gotta know
I'm here to fuck with niggas souls, my heart is cold
It's prolly cause I'm from the snow, with all my woes
I know they wanna see me go, I'm on a roll
I mean I'm back on this again, I'm here again
You know the truth, this not pretend, I'm not your friend
Not your guy, I'm not your buddy, show no lovin'
I might go DeMarcus Cousins out in public
Man, I'm back on this again, I'm here again
I didn't do this fuckin' tape for CNN
I am not tryna win awards, that shit looked forced
It's nothin' like this
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift

Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
Work, work the night shift

Someone to fuck me

Someone that's so proud to be with me
She walk right up to her ex, look him dead in the face
And say, "You ain't got the juice like that
You ain't got the juice like that"

Why you had to do him like that?
Gotta come through quick, quick

Yeah, she workin' with the spatula, I know she love flippin' shit
All, on me
I don't deserve it
She's just a little too perfect
She's just a little too worth it
I don't deserve her at all, no not at all

I'm still a canine at heart, I'm a dog

Yeah, that's why you gotta come through quick, quick
I'm posted at the Derek up on Westheimer, hit me when you're done your shift

A Mo City trip right now
Mo City trip, Mo City trip right now

Bitch so bad, coulda thought I owed her somethin'
By the way I broke her off
What she get in to, when we take it off
Drink so long, for a year I didn't cough
Fantasizin' and fistin' and switchin' up positions
Do you mind if we just menage just a little?

Mo City trip, Mo City trip right now


Having conversations with mama, man my life is a mess
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got google alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said "I heard you back with you know who"
I told her "Girl I'm always back with you know who"
And she like "Who are we kidding"
"You're 27 you just being you"
"You're your fathers child man thank god you got some me in you"
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher but your words still got me evolving
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solving
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that there's always someone better
Like that girl from that gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free thursday
And I'm sure that she's a angel but she don't want this life
The timing ain't right
Maybe one day but even one day with us is a time of a life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart but I'm not here to give out compliments, or boost nobody confidence momma
I got no friends in this momma
I don't pretend with this momma
I'on joke with this momma
I pull the knife out my back and cut they throat with it momma
I'm "Game of Thrones" with it momma
I'm "Home Alone" with it momma
I'm t-
I really hate using this tone with you momma
I really hate getting aggressive on this phone with you momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two momma
It's just they cloning me momma
Them niggas wannabes momma
Its like - I'm the one they wanna be momma
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable momma
I mean I kill em every time they do a song with me momma
I sing a hook they sing along with me momma
What more they want from me momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
"Don't ever take advice," that was great advice
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life

Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga memphis for real, girl he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
But he just want our forgiveness, and fuck it look how we living
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like
I used to rap on the phone, one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny shit could've gone south for me he looked out for me ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black, and now I'm here and I'm not black enough
Cause I'm not acting tough or making stories up bout where I'm actually from
But I just roll with it momma, rolling stone with it momma
Gotta be careful around rolling stones or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me momma
I'm not condoning it momma
They will not tear nothing down I built this home for you momma
Know I don't call enough momma
I just been working with so little time for personal momma
Hard labor let me pay the price
You and the six raised me right that shit saved my life


Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you do

These days, I'm letting God handle all things above me
The things I can't change are the reasons you love me
Listen you can hear them calling my name
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed
That or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' bout us, you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you, my time with you, my

Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you do

She said you're my everything
I love you through everything
I done did everything to her
She forgave me for everything, this a forever thing
Hate that I treat it like it's a whatever thing
Trust me girl, this shit is everything to me
She from the jungle, she from the jungle
I take somebody else's car, drive there undercover
This shit is everything to me, this shit is everything
Don't know where we stand, I used to hit you 'bout everything
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
If I need to talk are you around?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
You still down? You still down? You still down?

Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you do

These days these new girls: they got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switching majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do after we done everything that we've done?
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?


Yeah, yeah, oh you gotta love it
Oh you got, oh you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow I always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see them take at me? They all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep, wanting more
Tried to decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation but can't change it alone
I heard a little little homie talking reckless in Vibe
Quite a platform you chose, you shoulda kept it inside
Oh you tried, it's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
It gets worse by the annual my career's like a How-To manual
So I guess it's understandable man
Oh you gotta love it, you gotta love it cheer
I know rappers that call Paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed man, who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are, yeah
Lately I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my messages like we had words
And stories bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing crazy this year
Fuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it I guess I gotta wait til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news
So everybody can tweet about it
And then they start to RIP about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it
Oh you gotta love it
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public
That's a hotter subject
I've been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Bianca, Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance, part in my hair again
That's that comeback flow, comeback flow
Once I start it's apparent
I'm with girl whose ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions
And fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us
Winter here already but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas then we'll see what's up
Yeah, boy you rappin' like you seen it all
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of ya'll
"Best I Ever Had" seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes going off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh you gotta love it
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses
Putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they had a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
But man, oh, you gotta love it
And head to toe I'm Prada covered
I know your girl well, just not in public
Blame the city, I'm a product of it
Young nigga from the city
You gotta love it


Yeah, that's about it
This shit sound like what being rich feel like
Fo real
This life shit, is everywhere you can't control it
Too much going on
Too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much
You, you, you
Make me wanna take ya down through there
Make me wanna take ya down through there
I'll take it down

Why you never come to where I stay?
Always hiding out in your New York condo
Why you never come to where I stay?
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
Why are we rushing and forcing it? This isn't making sense
Why are we focused on things that don't even mean nothing, girl?
Why can we not find the time and sit down and discuss it, girl?
Let me at least tell you my side of things, man
Aw man, aw man
Aw, man

Me and you are playing house, start think that I'm losing touch
Got a tight grip on ya now, maybe I should loosen up
When I leave you and I go home, I start forgetting what it is
Start to think I got to get it how I live
We too busy for a wedding or a kid
If I'm working then I know you working
Keep in touch with other women, cause you make me nervous
I empower girls that don't deserve it
I don't mean to do that shit on purpose
It's just that when I go home, I start forgetting what it is
The dream is over, I get lost up in the 6

You don't ever come to where I stay
You just rather stay up in your New York condo
You don't ever come to where I stay
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
You know how sticky these situation get
You go up higher than me some days
You know what I think we could be some day
Let me at least show you my side of things, man
Aw man, aw man
Aw man

I rep the same gang on account of my niggas
We fill up two planes on account of these riches
I fuck up some loose change on account of these bitches

I be on syrup, they know it
Stack up some money then blow it
I do what I want and I spazz
Take the styrofoam, pour the syrup up
It's a dress code but it ain't for us

First I got married to money
Then I fell in love with that dirty
First I got married to money
Then I fell in love with that dirty
Extendo, extendo, extendo
The clip got a whole lot of 30
I got my clique and they represent this
Like a nigga wearin' jerseys
Like a nigga wearin' jerseys
Like we love wearin' jerseys
Crime rate's goin' crazy, crazy
Cause my young niggas so thirsty
Couple commas, made a purchase
Caught the wave, I ain't surfin'
Caught the wave, I ain't surfin'
You do what you want when you poppin'


Never thought I'd be talking from this perspective
But I'm not really sure what else you expected
When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective
With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message
40, did you get the message?
Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it
I mean, I say hats off for a solid effort
But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together
Yeah, not here to fight wars
But niggas wanna talk high scores
PARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche
And I just came from dinner where I ate some well done seared scallops that were to die for
But I got bigger fish to fry
I'm talking bigger shit than you and I
Kids'll lose their lives, got me scared of losing mine
And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified
Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night
Flying over Chattanooga, out here trying to spread the movement
I just got me the Mercedes Pullman
You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google
Back in the city, shit is getting brutal
These kids'll hit your noodle then take a girl to the movies
They've been dropping out on both sides
We ain't in it, we just ghost ride
The pen is working if you niggas need some ghost lines
I thought you wanted yours like I want mine
I guess you just making moves on your own time
But just know it'll be January in no time
And your absence is very concerning
It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returning
Shit is purely for sport, I need it 30 for 30
Banners are ready in case we need to retire your jersey
I got a club in the Raptors arena
Championships, celebrations during regular seasons
Paternity testing for women that I never slept with
I'm legally obligated if they request it
So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson
Luckily, I'm great at avoiding distraction
Used to get no reaction, now I'm overreacting
Ah nigga, that shit gotta go platinum
I just listened to Closer To My Dreams
Wide eyed and uneducated at 19
I can't rap like that, all young and naive
Not after all of the shit I've seen and the things I believe
Drastically changing, thank you for all your patience
I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it
4,000 square feet just isn't as spacious
You loved me back in the basement, guess it is what we make it
I'm tired of awkward exchanges and nigga's crooked ways
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away
Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother the season start
And I don't wanna see you end up with nothing
Y'all throw the word "family" around too much in discussion
Rookie season, I would've never thought this was coming
They knees give out and they passing to you all of a sudden
Now you the one getting buckets
They put their arm around you, now you becoming the crutches
Kids got on your number cause you the one they look up to
And women that you seen on TV look better in person
And either they wanna fuck you or convince you that they can to see where it goes from there
But these ain't the girls from Brampton, this ain't that local action
The haters just bringing me and my people closer, actually
What happened to the things you niggas said was supposed to happen?
Are we just supposed to ignore the fact that it never happened?
We just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two?
Supposed to forget your mistakes but not forget about you?
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
And treat the money like secrets, keep that shit to ourselves
Papi champ, young pablito de seis dios
6 G-O-D, I think I was destined for this shit when I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I
And Young Dro was popping off, well ain't I?
Way before niggas had they hands out like they doing macarena
But who am I to complain now, I'm still around, they know


It's a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond me

All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore

Always saw you for what you could've been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car that looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you could've been
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet and now we're meeting our end

And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

You're so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in L.A. I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's going on

And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving them all like I'm working for minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling the way
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day that

All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need your family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Much closer

Anytime people want to start problems
It's like "for real, are you dumb?"
You know who mans are
I'm not afraid no gyal heart man
And I'm not afraid of no cyattie
And I'm not afraid of no waste yute neither
So anybody who want it can get it
Seh feh

Magazine paper girl

They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial

What these bitches want from a nigga?

On some DMX shit
I group DM my exes
I told 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we're not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing to never lose me
LOLOL I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she's always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'

It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
It's like a lot of games are bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you're getting me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mind games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You send the "are you here?" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin' make sure to tell me

What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

Remember you was livin' at the London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career of reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade that they be throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow
Tryna give your ass the world
You runnin' your fingers through my curls
You knew me when the kid had waves
But that's enough of that
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass
And that's some real shit


I should be downtown, whipping on the way to you
You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?
Changing your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you don't have the time to wait on me

I try with you
There's more to life than sleeping in
And getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it

Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
Cause you don't mean it anyway, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Maybe we should have just did things my way
Instead of the other way

I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in
And getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say


Man don't live of a di hype huh?
Real ting ay

I pull up on you in that purple thing bumpin' Purple Rain
Singin' "Purple Rain, " sippin' purple rain
Pourin' champagne off commercial fame
You ain't worth a thing, you ain't gang gang
You ain't flame gang, you ain't same gang
It's my world, it's Wayne's world
It's a different world, it's Dewayne Wayne, oh Lord
Okay now we got some action
Fuck models out of Maxim
I'm too wavy, I'm a captain
Okay now we got some rapids
Orange bottle full of tablets
Okay now we got some habits
Smokin' cookies, sippin' lean
Okay now we got some balance
You see my team is right next to me
You don't see Tina right next to me
I thank her for takin' my breath from me
But the second me gon' be the better me
J.R. Smith with the shot
Cause I pull up, I stop and pop
I call my AK Barney
And I'm a let this baby pop
Pull up on you like Steph Curry
With my foot up on you like F worries
Been outchea since Keith Murray
Codeine got me with pink urine
So you know I don't have the energy
I fucked a bitch named Epiphany
My exes wanna be friends with my other exes
And I don't have the sympathy

Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

Yeah, I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need addressin'
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my lil homie
'09 they was biddin' on me
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me
Ok now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But off verses, he been blackin'
Chasin' women a distraction
They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

I don't take this shit for granted
I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
6 cold like Alaska
Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta go, they gotta go
They gonna die out eventually
I cannot give 'em no empathy
I'm a have B's when I'm 70
They cannot fuck with the legacy
I don't know what else is left for me
After this no one a threat to me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done


One of them ones
Right
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century runnin' the store for centuries
Then bring it back to your brother man we had to respect it
He was wavy doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but man there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like what are those
I mean you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy we tradin' places
Lookin' in the mirror I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care and no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it
I might be here as a vessel to teach people the lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings faded
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect, you don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinum like rappers on Hershey's boy that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD we relate we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my Momma that I found a lady in the east
Came cool when I got signed, upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti treat
Now the talk of the corner store is that I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain't always how it seems when it's sewed together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Don't let your new found fame fool you or cloud up your judgement
To talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' hypnotic with Glenn Louis I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
To busy face screwin' on waste movements
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it
But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I want
Yeah, that's right
Yeah


Yeah, I get it
I get it
Yeah

Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman to feel like she needs me?
I lost my way

I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Oh please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah

Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with no one else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah

Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now, yeah

Say to you
But 80 percent of it was the truth, yeah
Say to you
A Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin' was for me and you
Girl, really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Clicked up with Jessica, Kim, you know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah

They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah
Aww yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now

Damn
I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they wish it could've been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven
Tryna satisfy everybody
It's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough
And then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven

Busy as usual but we should make some time
Looking for things you can find
Just so you can have something to bring up when it's time
Mixing vodka and emotions, tapping into your emotions
Dry cry cause I'm hopeless
Choose your lover for the moment
Different story when I leave you
Story of just to keep you
I need you around, I need you, oh

It's about us right now, girl, where you going?

But you get real on a pill and I like it
You just like my sidekick, I just wanna wife,
Fulfill all your desires
Keep you in the front, never in the back
And never on the side, yeah

You a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it

Look, you know I'm a rider, nothin' left to hide
Your other nigga tired
Talk about you like you'll never leave his side
But I don't really buy it
Me I'm movin' quiet, all the things we're tryin'
Let's just keep it private
Don't say anything
Tell me should I cut these other girls right out of my life?
'Cause we never decided
Tell me how you feel inside

You a real ass woman and I like it
Dedicate to you
I need you inspired, I need you excited
I don't wanna fight it

I figure out you, you figure out me
We both a different breed
I'm followin' your lead, I ask you what you need
You say a guarantee
I mean you say that like it's easy
You never believe me
Told you I got Zs for these other girls sleepin' on em
Girl I'm sleepy
Sometimes I'm so indecisive

But you a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it

I give you my all
I dedicate, I dedicate, whoa yeah
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, baby, dedicate
I dedicate to you
I dedicate, I dedicate
This song's for you
I dedicate, I dedicate
I give you my all
I give you my voice
This song's for you


Question is will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no, no, no, no
Question is will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no, no, no, no

Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression coming out of my section
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playing dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They been saying it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at JD's connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesays, I was buying fitteds everyday
Kenny's caravan and trying not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had a saddest day
"It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait"
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
I'm getting straight to the point with it
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas
Fuck being all buddy buddy with the opposition
It's like a front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute

Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards them goals
My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
Who you think running this show?
You saw it in me at 20 years old
The lingo start to sound like we talking in code
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
You don't worry 'bout fitting in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doing shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers going unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feeling like I'm Christian Bale
And I never bare my morals for the ticket sales
Tipping scales, bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
Running through the 6, storming through the contracts
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got something left to prove since you left me room
Paint a plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's going in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pre the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karma's such a thing of beauty
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
It's far fetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it 100 like I'm running a fever
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you
If I was you, I wouldn't like me either


You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
Yeah

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city
You got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city
You started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city
You, you got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rollin' up a backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone, yeah
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city...


Is it the strength of your feelings
Overthrowing your pain
Using you high to be reaching
And is it today that you will find your new release
And in your wake, ripple your sweet voice

And more chune for your head tops
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?

Yeah, I couldn't get a bill paid
You couldn't buy the real thing
I was stayin' up at yo' place
Tryin' to figure out the whole thing
I saw people doin' things
Almost gave up on the music thing
But we all so spoiled now
More life, more everything
Must have never had your phone tapped
All that yappin' on the phone shit
You must really love the road life
All that never comin' home shit

Free smoke, free smoke, aye!
Free smoke, free smoke, aye!
Free smoke, free smoke, aye!

Hello
I've been hurt so many times
It got to a point
When I decided
I can't do this anymore
I need someone to hold me
I need someone that needs me
I need someone that loves me

You need me to get that shit together
So we can get together
You need me to get that shit together
So we can get together
You need me to

You know, we don't have to be dramatic
Just romantic
Do all the little things, little things, little things
That excites me
As your woman
Give me a kiss goodnight
Over the phone
When you're working late
When you're out of town
Tell me how much you need this
'Cause we deserve it
We can be together, but

You need me to get that shit together

Your mind impure, soul I possess, he knows it
Anointed and protected, I was chosen
My heart is way too frozen to get broken

You say you changed
But you never change up


Herms link, ice-blue mink

They want me gone, wait for the kicker
Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my nigga

Yeah, October Firm in the cut
Stay at the top like I'm stuck
That's just how I'm givin' it up
She wanna get married tonight
But I can't take a knee, 'cause I'm wearin' all white
Me and my broski are twins, but we don't look alike
I don't take naps
Me and the money are way too attached to go and do that
Muscle relax
That and a spliff put me right on my back, I gotta unpack
Virginia Black
I could go make enough money off that and not even rap
What's that? Facts?
Contract max, I gotta bring that shit back

Herms link, ice-blue mink
Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is
They want me gone, out of the picture
Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my, word to my...

I'm so hot, yeah, I'm so right now
Who's not gang, bitch? Let me find out
Keep hearin' clicks when I'm talkin' on the iPhone
Feds in the city hate to see us on a high note
I switch flow like I switch time zone
Can't get Nobu, but you can get Milestone
I gotta do mansion 'cause I outgrew condo
Got a new Maybach, she wanna fuck on the drive home
Yeah, met her once and I got through
I'm never washed, but I'm not new
I know I said top five, but I'm top two
And I'm not two and I got one
Thought you had one, but it's not one, nigga, nah

Herms link, ice-blue mink
Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is
They want me gone, wait for the kicker
Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my nigga


It's a madness
Check my account, it's a madness (Mmm)
Block that account, it's a catfish (Yeah)
Block that account, it's a catfish (Dubplate special)
Check my account, that's a madness
Check my account, that's a madness (OVO, BBK)
Block that account, that's a catfish
Block that account, that's a catfish

You don't know me, you better get to know me
Stand up tall, right next to Kobe
A young G, I had the weapon on me
Slice up work like pepperoni (shing)
The police still arrest the homies
No statement, no testimony
Spit in your face with extra bogey
It's my time, I don't flex a Rollie
On cloud 9, a man's extra cosy (greaze)
I might switch it up and direct a movie
Pussyholes tried to execute me
Died and came back as Fela Kuti
Don't phone me, send a text to Julie
OVO, man's so unruly
South by, ride out, no Suzuki
Got the Austin Powers, a man's extra groovy
Greaze, front row, jacket tailor-made
Crackhead swag with the razor blade
Red umbrella when I make it rain
My whole team winnin', we don't play your game
Sound like me, but they ain't the same
See them online tryna fake the fame
They wanna bust jokes, they think I'm Damon Wayans

It's a madness
Check my account, it's a madness (More Life)
Block that account, it's a catfish
Block that account, it's a catfish (OVO, BBK)
Check my account, that's a madness (dubplate)
Check my account, that's a madness (street team)
Block that account, it's a catfish
Block that account, it's a catfish

Yeah, they're nothin' like me, I'm a fuckin' villain
Go against me, that's a tough decision
Police wish I was stuck in prison
Fish-eye lens on my tunnel vision (straight)
Real life greaze when I touch the riddim
Still the same guy when I touched a million
Record labels wanted us to listen
But it's greatness only for the love of Britain
I say it how it is and no fucks are given
Greaze, so don't forget to remember me
Especially all my enemies
Keep your eyes on me with your jealousy
The most solid gang that you will ever see
Just came back from the embassy
Check my crime sheet, check my legacy
And now I'm back on tour, so what you tellin' me?
(Greaze) Taliban, Halloween
Pull up in the whip with the gasoline
Yeah, that's that boy from the magazine
Bust my dance at the cash machine
Make her back it up, bounce on my trampoline
Like Martin Luther, man, I had a dream
Now it's my world, you can have the scene

It's a madness
Check my account, it's a madness
Block that account, it's a catfish
Block that account, it's a catfish
Check my account, that's a madness
Check my account, that's a madness
Block that account, it's a catfish
Block that account, it's a catfish


(Murda on the beat, so it's not nice)
Yeah
It's a Habibis ting, ya?

Yeah, my side girl got a 5S with the screen cracked
Still hit me back right away, better not never hesitate
Don't come around thinkin' you gettin' saved
Tryna show the dogs brighter days
Got a torch, tryna light the way
Bitin' everybody, which is ironic 'cause your next album probably won't ever see the light of day
Had fans, but you let 'em down
But I guess that's how you niggas gettin' down
I'm so high up I'm like, "How is niggas really gettin' down?"
I could never have a kid, then be out here still kiddin' round
Boys playin' around, where you really wanna take it now?
I got a 150, 000 dollars for an afterparty
And I gave it to the killas just to break it down
Bring us up, I never take us down
But if you bring me up, then they might take you down
Fake fucked with me back then
But it's gettin' hard for you to fake it now
Fuck bein' rich when I'm forty, man, I'm tryna make it now

Hell nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah

Griselda Blanco with the trap moves
Gangland with the right hand
Undertaker with the tattoos
Never listen to the class rules
Switch it up, they bit the last move (let's go!)
I'm a magnet for bad bitches
You got the goin' out sad bitches
I spent a fifty on the chain (racks)
You spent your last fifty (ugh, cash)
I got the keys to the streets
You got the key to defeat
I got the keys to the warzone (brrrapt!)
You got the key to the peace (ugh)

Hell nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Park the Benz just to ride the Wraith
Skrrt skrrt
Ten million dollars, gotta hide the safe

We gon' go live, we gon' go live, yep
We gon' go live, we gon' go live, yep
Gettin' loose, off the Henny, 'Roc, and a hint of Goose
Ocean deep in my swimmin' pool
Throwin' Dead Prez in my livin' room
Takin' shots, feelin' bulletproof
Flood my Rollie, told my bitch: "Let's go snorkelin'!"
Out in Portland, tryna get in her organs
No, I did not sign with Jay
But I still send a Tidal wave
Yeah, I might just go get the fade
Buy the du-rag and just tie the waves
Yeah, it's lit at the crib, you could stay
Me and Drake kick like Kid N' Play
The way that she servin' that cake
I gotta sit back and digest
I guess, for the fuck-shit I'm biased
I mix, double the cup when I stress
Got my momma out the basement
That's a different type of face lift
Free Max B out the bracelets
Don't hit us askin' what the wave is

Hell nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Park the Benz just to the ride the Wraith
Skrrt skrrt
Ten million dollars, gotta hide the safe
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Phelps with the swim moves
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Jordan with the tennis shoes
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Phelps with the swim moves
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Jordan with the tennis shoes

But I don't wanna take pictures in the restroom
Drench God with the 6 God, point guard and the two guard
"Pretty Girls Like Trap Music"
So I woke up with my wood hard

And I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
We seein' so many blessings, shit don't make no sense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to him
Yeah, I'm convinced

Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to-

I was stealin' from a bitch, back when I was 21
My favorite gun was a SIG, 20 in the clip, head one
Growin' up, I was a runnin' back

That shit was red like Hunt (ketchup)
I'm kickin' pimpin' like I punt
But don't you think shit's sweet?

You ever hear some slow tracks, you know what I'm sayin'?
With, like, some pimpin' to it, or somethin'
That you can relax, pop a top to, or somethin'?

Big cup of Ac', I'm drowsy
I'm still posted up where you first found me
Did I just read that you just got engaged on me?
I heard from your friend, you couldn't even tell me
Or better yet wait on me

Nah, should have known nah-nah-nah
Should have known nah-nah-nah
Can't just leave it off that way
Should have known nah-nah-nah
Should have known nah
Can't just leave it off that way, nah

Least, do I get an invitation or something?
A statement or something?
Ask about that, you would say it was nothing
But here's another nothing that you made into something
Can't just leave it off that way


Your heart is hard to carry after dark
You're to blame for what we could have been
'Cause look at what we are
Your friends are scared to tell you you're in too far
Funny that it's always been all about you from the start
I met someone new last night and we kicked it
And I'm going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, this time
Going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

Out of body
That's just how I feel when I'm around you, shawty
Last night we didn't say it
But girl, we both thought it
Why second guess? I should have stayed
You say the word, I'm on the way
This shit feels like teenage fever
I'm not scared of it, she ain't either
Why second guess? I should have stayed
'Cause you know what's on my mind tonight

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

Yeah, slightly took a left turn there
But very much 6AM
Slightly been awake for 24 hours, so please forgive me
More ideas and stuff comin'
Yeah, yeah, fam
I'm wafflin', but man is tired, fam, Jesus Christ


(Ness on the beat)
Yeah
Okay, okay
Okay

B Man just got out the can
I gave my bro an advance (yeah)
Love is just not in my plans
Not even takin' a chance
Studio right in my yard
I'm doin' ten in a week
How long I been on this streak?
Dream about work in my sleep
Okay, I got a lock on the streets
Shoutout to T, he did three
And he brought it in 'cause of me
You don't know nothin' 'bout me
Life for my bruddas is deep
Long as they all on they feet
Long as they pockets is grease (grease!)
I'm in the penthouse, but still nothin' is sweet (yeah)
Dust a man down with the pen, it's a sweep (Mmmm!)
Taller in person, you'll see when we meet
I heard your new shit and I'm kissin' my teeth
(Jheeze)

Bringin' that dirty, dirty, bringin' that certy
Nizzy with the quick extension, ringin' off thirty
I've got bitches and they're murky, swervin', lookin' all curvy
And you already know I love them breasts, lookin' all perky
Lookin' all Christmas gift-wrapped, lookin' all turkey
Spend jumped out the Ghost in a suit, lookin' all churchy
Fingers all itchin', twitchin', lookin' all jerky
Whippin' that white girl, cookin' that Cersei
I'm just pushin' that dark shit, pushin' that charcoal
Now this is that big bad, this is Gustavo
Look at them jokers, look at that arsehole
Man are gettin' bread now, this is that hard dough
Clap man, dominant murder
I'm a black man, government earner
Could've just slapped man, but he wanted it further
Batman, da-na-na-da-na

October Firm


I don't care what society thinks. They're nothing anyway. They're no better than me. Out there you just have to fit into a pattern that somebody's already laid out for you. Life we live, you have to set your own patterns, your own ideals. You have to handle the whole job yourself. (Yeah)

No snow tires, the rain slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina
Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season
Queen Street visions that nobody believed in
If we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin'
Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to Weeknd
The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'
Not when everybody out here beefin'
We got it, now we just gotta keep it
America's most wanted, man, I'm still on the run
All these number ones and we still not the ones
No hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun
Went and got diplomas, and we still goin' dumb
Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin'
My competition, it's beyond offensive
I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention
Not tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distance
Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission
This the remix to "Ignition," hot and fresh out the kitchen
How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches?
Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it
Too late for condolences when it's over with
I need to start sayin' shit when I notice it
Be open with people I need some closure with
Be honest with myself and take ownership
Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn
I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first
Excitin' times, revitalized
Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
I'm just takin' what God will give me
Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey
Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me
I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky
I wrote the book on world-class finesses
And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts
And never placin' second
And even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second
Inspirin' and never takin' credit
I know I deserve more, I just never said it
Two middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah

Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

Winnin' is problematic
People like you more when you workin' towards somethin'
Not when you have it
Way less support from my peers
In recent years as I get established
Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage
Why is my struggle different than others'?
Only child that's takin' care of his mother
As health worsens and bills double
That's not respectable all of a sudden?
I don't get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write
And not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me
But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin' me at all
To wantin' to see me lose it all?
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'
I'm overcome with emotions
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'
And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'
And puttin' your trust in someone
With the risk of financially sinkin'
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies
Ego strokin', picture postin'
Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin'
I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired
I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet
Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you

Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?


Yeah, uh, man, fresh up out the sand
February 10, it's the boy, but I'm still the man
Come and get your mans
I don't know, first you caught the hands
Then you took the stand
It's a joke, but you say you real-I don't understand
On a yacht, me and all the dogs actin' like some dogs
We evolved, used to think vacation meant Niagara Falls
Swear to God, shout to Buffalo, never duckin' low
I don't stop, man, I'm stuck on go, always hug the row
Fuck a opp, make his body roll, yeah, a lot of those
Started out doin' college shows, Calipari flow
Then I popped like you never seen
We with everything, I went off in the '16, give me '17

Want a lot, can't have everything
Can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything
But I want everything

Bad attitude, tellin' who to calm down?
Tryna cool it all down
Who's callin' my name? Who's involved now?
Tell me who I gotta down, I'll do a song now, man
Even though there's way less to prove to y'all now, man
Everything that went around is comin' back around
Y'all better hit the ground
Goddamn, beef forever unfinished
Yeah, it's all open ended, had me off for a minute
Had you all since beginnin'
Damn, I must be coachin', 'cause I'm not playin' with them
Can you not see the difference?
I mean, I keep the fuckin' lights on in the buildin'
Man, my record deal should be 500 million, goddamn

Can't have everything
Can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything
But I want everything

Finally got my mind in a free state
Niggas tried to serve me up a cheesesteak
I gave them back a clean plate
Same niggas preein', 'cause they hate to see the team straight
Same niggas beakin' always duckin' my release date
That's when the phone starts ringin', like, "Are we straight?"
Two-faced nigga back around with the three face
Damn, oh, triple double, Russ face
Watch with the bust face
Never met the plug, but I rap about the plug face
Never met my self, I don't remember who I was face
Y'all fuckin' hilarious
Y'all really think you niggas teamin' up and scarin' us
Y'all niggas is arrogant, y'all sleep at the Sheraton
All that shit embarrassin'
Tell your big homie I'm all for goin' there again
He ain't even die and I ball with his inheritance
All that's in my account at the Bank of America
All that Drake hysteria
Six side, east side, all that for my area

You know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainly stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I'm confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days. When others go low, we go high.


Watch out for me, I'm bound to glow
You better watch out for me, I'm bound to glow

Your boy all glowed up
Every time we touch down, bet it go up
'Member doin' shows, ain't nobody show up
Pour your heart out, ain't nobody show love
They used to laugh when my whip was on the tow truck
'Til me and bein' broke finally broke up
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
Time to shake the dice, time to change the li-I-ight
No more 9 to 5, autopilot dri-I-I've
Used to work the fries, now we supersi-I-ize
We go suit and tie, we gon' touch the sky-y-y
We so certified, we so certifi-I-ied
Fuck you haters still, that's an F-Y-I-I-I
They gon' bang this here all summerti-I-ime
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow

Yeah, yeah
Turn me way up, my voice is really low
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay

(Watch out) Watch out-why, nigga?
(The cops out) Cops out
It's all love when I ride top down
Top down (I started out way down low)
Started from the bottom, now we here now
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
We about to get the whole nine
The whole nine, we just landed on a gold mine
We the new Abu Dhabi, this is our time

Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
I just take the dreams I've been sold
And sell 'em for more, you already know
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow

Hope I deal with karma 'fore my son do
'Cause I be drivin' round this bih with no sunroof
Man, the glow got me feelin' like I'm gunproof

Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
I still have my guard up
Blame this thing I'm part of
Tryin' to avoid more confrontation
I just gotta try harder
Takin' the time to clear my mind
'Cause soon as I'm able to let that go

Watch out for me, I'm bound to glow

Through devotion
Blessed are the children
We love y'all too!
We believe if there's anything y'all wanna do in life
You need devotion
Can I hear right on? (screams)
Through devotion
Blessed are the children
We live for it
Clap your hands and see me
Come on, y'all
I said it's alright
Clap your hands and see me
Come on, y'all


Yeah

According to my, as you beg I testified it
I been alone, girl, you finally got me on my own
I know and I miss you
Know how to treat you, but it's difficult
Thank God I'm Christian
Remember how this all begun, just us
My mama said you was bad news, like "dun-dun-dun-dun"
You proved her right, every single night
Oh my, oh my, can't close my eyes
Can't open my eyes, don't know what to do
I'm in some kind of mood
You're so beautiful, you're so beautiful
We gotta listen to the old Kelly
You slipped out of feelin' already

Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you
Girl, I know you

Girl, I know you know already
What haven't we done before?
What is not already mine?
Couldn't tell you were special

You said that you think about me every day
Saturday to Saturday
You see that I've been goin' through it
Hopin' everything's okay
I just want to let you know
Everything these days is textual
I just want to get a little sexual, with you
Because I remember way, way back
With the waves under the wavecap
You were someone else's wife in fact
You didn't even look at me like that
Then it all just switched, over time
Step by step and you know what's next
Girl, I can't pretend

We gon' have to listen to some old Kelly
You slipped up if you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know how it's gon' go down
I know you, babe

Girl, I know you know already
What haven't we done before?
What is not already mine?
Couldn't tell you were special
Yeah, you know already

Six months since I've been back in the Six
I can't help but wonder how you've been, babe
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
Wonder how you've been
I've been out in Bel-Air like Will was
These streets got so familiar
Malibu coast where I meditate
Book a plane home, then I hesitate
Scared to see what I left behind
It's weighin' heavy on my mind
And I can't help but wonder how you've been, baby
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
Wonder how you've been, babe


Yeah, yeah

I've been down so long it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face

Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Look like you hidin' your problems
Really you never were solid
No you can't son me, you won't never get to run me
Just when shit look out of reach, I reach back like one, three
Like one, three, yeah

That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake

Since then, things never been the same

That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place

Feelin' rough, rough
Baby, I'm needin' somethin', somethin'
I wan' beat it up with somethin' somethin'
You're a diamond out the rough or somethin' somethin'
You need to give it up to someone
You need to give love to someone
You need to-fuck what you need!
You need to give it up to someone
Before you end up like
Woah, woah, woah, woah, like
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah, yeah

Look, I want you to myself
But I know you just left someone else
I know you did, he did a number on you
That must be why you move so icy
Icy like 1017
Icy like there's nobody who'd ever need
Better not give that all to anyone but me
Patient as could be, but

I still need some satisfaction
A little less talk and a little more action
I need you out in Jamaica, relaxin'
Thought I had everything somehow

Feelin' rough, rough
Baby, I'm needin' somethin', somethin'
I wan' beat it up with somethin' somethin'
You're a diamond out the rough or somethin' somethin'
You need to give it up to someone
You need to give love to someone

Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah, yeah

I wanna see you do more in this life if we takin' it there
I want to see you do 911, fuck a Panamera
See you when I see the real thing
Gettin' realer and realer, yeah, yeah, yeah
But you icy like 1017
Icy like there's nobody you'll ever need
Better not give that up
I'm here patient as can be, man

I still need some satisfaction
A little less talk and a little more action
I need you out in Jamaica, relaxin'
Thought I had everything somehow

Feelin' rough, rough
Baby, I'm needin' somethin', somethin'

Jeffery
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah (yeah, yeah)
Woah, woah, woah, woah


Yeah, stylin' though
Dissin', but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin' dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with Ian Throw
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on a rotary phone
I take a glass, it don't mean, "Nah, don't go with me home."
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need 40, 000 people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry youth when I was writin' Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I'll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin' the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin' up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til morning on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assure that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up to a club 'less we doin' bis'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me, and frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I Told You that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is set around competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary
More Life


Yeah, they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me

I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
I don't wanna die for them to miss me
Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me

God's plan, God's plan
I hold back, sometimes I won't (yeah)
I feel good, sometimes I don't, ayy, don't
I finessed down Weston Road, ayy, 'nessed
Might go down a G.O.D., yeah, wait
I go hard on Southside G, (yeah, wait)
I make sure that north-side eat

And still
Bad things
It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me
Bad things
It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me
Yuh, ayy, ayy

She said, "Do you love me?" I tell her, "Only partly"
I only love my bed and my momma, I'm sorry
Fifty Dub, I even got it tatted on me
81, they'll bring the crashers to the party
And you know me
Turn the O2 into the O3, dog
Without 40, Oli, there would be no me
Imagine if I never met the broskies

God's plan, God's plan
I can't do this on my own, ayy, no, ayy
Someone watchin' this shit close, yep, close
I've been me since Scarlett Road, ayy, road, ayy
Might go down as G.O.D., yeah, wait
I go hard on Southside G, ayy, wait
I make sure that north-side eat
And still

Bad things
It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me
Yeah, yeah
Bad things
It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me
Yeah


Diplomatic immunity, fuck 'em
All that peace and that unity
All that weak shit'll ruin me, fuck 'em, yeah
'Cause niggas started talkin' to me like I'm slowin' down
Opinions over statistics, of course
Gassed off journalistic
Come at me and all you'll get is the ballistic report
Booked a private room at Wylie's, waiter twistin' the cork
I got multi-colored rings like the Olympics, of course
At award shows, cuttin' through the tension, of course
Girls huggin' me then askin' me, "what scent that is, boy?"
I be walkin' around the Six, like I invented it, boy
Yeah, who am I? The do or die, the one with the fewest lies
And the truest ties, they try to compare us but
Like a job straight out of high school
There's no you and I
I taught you everything you know, now you got student pride
All factual
I call the house, the embassy
The studio, the chapel, I hate to travel
I just pulled up on Solana show, the girl's a natural
I knew her way back when Hollywood was international
Yeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends
Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my 'Benz
Very presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential
I broke spirits that I never meant to
My body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine
And sleep at the opposite times
Promise shit is gettin' out of line, like when you make a stencil
Or getting out of line, like when you break a pencil
Violatin' the treaty of Versailles, champagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I
I refuse to comply with regulations, I listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence
Like Sanders on the Detroit Lions
Get a run around and I'll bury you where they won't find you
Motor City Casino, I'm at the cage with my old license
They tell me "don't worry, I got your money" like Osirus
(I'm the Osiris of this shit)
Dirty 30, workin' on me
Tired of women that may tag me in pictures, airin' my dirty laundry
Caterin' is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite
Shit is nice, but I prefer Madeo
Calamari rings and tomato
I got the sauce and now shorty's keep claimin' "preggo"
Waking up at 6 PM like "where does the day go?"
Forecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin' retaliation at dinner tables
2010 was when I lost my halo
2017 I lost a J. Lo
A Rotterdam trip had me on front page, though
I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes
Closed off but I could never stay closed
Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sureos
Black excellence, but I guess when it comes to me its not the same though
All goodie, that just pushed me to do the things we all couldnt
Niggas stakin' out the crib, its all gravy
Protection that God gave me
Shit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies
I gotta watch who Im talkin' to like its all agents
Ive seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers
Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here
Cover my ears, my security government tier
Yeah, advance the venue so we know the exits
Check the guest list, if opps make an appearance at least its expected
Tell em I dont want to link like a broken necklace
Ill be in better company with my own reflection
Mirror, mirror, on the ceilin' of my suite in the Royal Palace
The TV playin' Al Jazeera
Inshallah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin' clearer
Whenever, wherever, OVO will always be together like Shakira

I love, I love
I love, I love it
Baby, I


I been waitin' on this
Yeah

All of this disorder, no addressin'
The crown is broken in pieces, but there's more in my possession 
There's a whole lot in my possession
Who do you really love?
Well, that's sure to be in question
My Mount Rushmore is me with four different expressions
Who's givin' out this much return on investment?
After my run, man, how is that even a question?
After this summer, man, how is that even a
I've had real Philly niggas try to write my endin'
Takin' shots with the gold and talk about shots that we sendin'
I've had scuffles with bad boys that wasn't pretendin'
I've had too many nights to mention, that's just the beginnin'
I'm pretty sure we got a label, I'm still independent
I fell back a hundred times when I don't get the credit
Seen this movie a hundred times, I know where it's headed
Realize someone gotta die when no one'll dead it
Niggas gamblin' with they life for some content
That's the type of lottery that could get your top picked
I am a cream of the crop, nigga
You niggas pop mollies, my Mali's pop niggas
House on both coasts, but I live on the charts
I have tea with the stars and I swim with the sharks
And I see in the dark, wasn't this cold at the start
Think my soul has been marked, there's a hole in my heart
Yeah, I was about to
Man, I thought about it
It's unsettlin' to talk about it
Free all of my niggas that they caught with it
RIP my niggas that they caught without it
This just a intro, let me not get ahead of myself
This is God's plan, young man, you said it yourself
Always got a ace up my sleeve for whatever was dealt
Daddy got suits like Bernie Mac, he dresses himself
I stopped askin' myself and I started feelin' myself
Now I gotta deal with all this drama and deal with myself
I ain't even have to cut the tie, it severed itself
This just the intro, let me not get ahead of myself


Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up

Look, I just flipped a switch (flipped, flipped)
I don't know nobody else that's doing this
Bodies start to drop, ayy, hit the floor
Now they wanna know me since I hit the top, ayy
This a Rollie, not a stopwatch, shit don't ever stop
This the flow that got the block hot, shit got super hot
Give me my respect, give me my respect
I just took it left like I'm ambidex
Bitch, I move through London with the eurostep
Got a sneaker deal and I ain't break a sweat
Catch me 'cause, I'm going, outta there, I'm gone
How I go from 6 to 23 like I'm LeBron?
Servin' up a pack, servin' up a pack
Niggas pullin' gimmicks 'cause they scared to rap
Funny how they shook, ayy, got these niggas shook
Pullin' back the curtain by myself take a look, ayy
I'm a bar spitta, I'm a hard hitta
Yeah I'm light skinned, but I'm still a dark nigga
I'm a wig splitta, I'm a tall figure
I'm a unforgiving wild-ass dog nigga
Somethin' wrong with 'em, got 'em all bitter
I'm a bill printer, I'm a grave digger
Yeah, I am what I am
I don't have no time for no misunderstandings again

My head is spinnin'
From smokin' the chicken
The bass is kickin'

Future took the business and ran it for me
I let Ollie take the Owl, told him brand it for me
I get 2 million a pop and that's standard for me
Like I went blind dog you gotta hand it to me (gotta gimme that shit, dog)
Prayed, then I prayed again (Amen, Lord)
Had a moment but it came and went (They don't love you no more)
You don't wanna play with him (nah, nah, nah)
They'll be mourning you like 8AM (R.I.P)
Pinky ring till I get a wedding ring (woah, yeah)
Love my brothers, cut 'em in on anything (big slice)
And you know it's King Slime Drizzy damn
She just said I'm bae, I hit the thizzle dance (Mac Dre shit, damn)
Either hand is the upper hand (oh, yeah, shit)
Got a bubba on my other hand (oh, yeah, shit, yeah)
This shit ain't no hundred bands (nah, nah, nah, nah)
Palace look like Buckingham
Bills so big I call 'em Williams, for real
Reasons to go crazy, got a trillion for real
They been trying me but I'm resilient for real
I can't go in public like civilian for real
And I hardly take offense
Money for revenge, man that's hardly an expense
Al Haymon checks off of all of my events
I like all the profit man I hardly do percents (I don't do that shit)
A big part of me resents niggas that I knew from when I started in this shit
They see what I got and man it's hard to be content
Fuck what they got goin' on I gotta represent

Ayy, elevate, elevate
Only obligation is to tell it straight
So much on my plate I gotta delegate
Baka passed a drug test, we gotta celebrate
I'm in bed awake, thinkin' how'd I make
All this happen for myself and my family
All this happen for myself and my family
There's no way that this is real, man, it can't be
(Yeah, yeah)

If you need me, you can't call me, I stay busy makin' money
You know what is on my mind, all I think about is hunnids
I stay busy (Bzz!) workin' on me
I stay busy with my business, homie
I already hit her when you left her lonely
She is not the type that likes to take things slowly
Slowly, my mouth is goin' off, I don't know patience
I got a chance then my niggas got it too like it's contagious
I see the future when I get wavy (Wavy God!)
But I couldn't picture bein' Champagne (Haan) when I would buy that shit and save it for the right occasion
I couldn't picture changes
When I was with Ms. Creighton, that lady hates me
Couldn't picture wifin' Braden when I was pumpin' gas on road trips to go from Cincinnati on to Dayton
I couldn't gauge it
I wanna thank God for workin' way harder than Satan
He's playin' favourites, it feels amazin' (Yeah)

Elevate, elevate
Only obligation is to tell it straight
Me and all the guys found a better way
This a life bid we can never separate
I'm in bed awake, thinkin' how'd I make
All this happen for myself and my family
All this happen for myself and my family
There's no way that this is real, man, it can't be

Yeah, I can only tell you shit in pieces
As it happens to me, I begin to write the thesis
Franny got the Aria setup like it's a Freaknik
Vegas like Marineland, that big whale treatment
Georgie got me up a hunnid thousand for the weekend
I gotta move the safe beside the bed when I be sleepin'
My mood is changin' this summer, I'ma be tweakin'


You've got me feeling emotions
Higher, ooah
You've got me fe-
You've, ohh

Don't link me
Don't hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
I know the truth is you won't love me until I'm gone
And even then the thing that comes after is movin' on
I can't even capture the feeling I had at first
Meeting all my heroes like seeing how magic works
The people I look up to are going from bad to worse
Their actions out of character even when they rehearse
Working in the land of the free, the home of the brave
I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place
Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved
And they don't like that it's written all on they face
I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean
Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team
Iconic duos rip and split at the seams
Good hearted people are takin' it to extremes
Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe
Leavin' me to ask what's their motive and makin' peace
Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet
Leavin' me to ask is there anybody like me?

You've got me fe-
You've, ohh
You've got me fe-
You, ohh
Ayye

Missing out on my years
It's time when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missing out on my days
Scrolling through life and fishing for praise
Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
I'm tryna see who's there on the other end of the shade
Most times it's just somebody that's underage
That's probably just alone and afraid
And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain
I always hear people complain about the place that they live
That all the people here fake and they got nothin' to give
'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit
That makes another city seem more exciting than it is
I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome
Then she finally got to Rome
And all she did was post pictures for people at home
'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known
I know another girl that's cryin' out for help
But her latest caption is "Leave me alone"
I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown
To post later and make it look like she still on the go
Look at the way we live
I wasn't hiding my kid from the world
I was hiding the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up and looked to debate
Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate
Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs
The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call
They always ask, "Why let the story run if it's false?"
You know a wise man once said nothin' at all
I'm exhausted and drained I can't even pretend
All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch
All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end
I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then

You've got me fe-
You've, ohh
Ayye
Higher, higher
You've got me fe-
You've, ohh
Ayye
Higher, higher


Yeah
I'm workin' on dyin'

I'm upset
Fifty thousand on my head, it's disrespect
So offended that I had to double check
I'ma always take the money over sex
That's why they need me out the way
What you expect?

Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no hoe
Every month, I'm supposed to pay her bills
And get her what she want
I still got like seven years of doin' what I want
My dad still got child support from 1991
Outta town, people love to pop a lot of shit then come around
Word to Flacko Jodye, he done seen us put it down
Niggas askin' if I'm cool

I'm upset
Hunnid thousand on my head, it's disrespect
So offended that I had to double check

You tryna check?
This is real life, niggas think we playin' chess
So what's next?
Jump up out the bed like I'm possessed
I go out on tour and I say I'm drinkin' less
End up gettin' loose and gettin' pictures from my ex
SMS, triple X
That's the only time I ever shoot below the neck (skrr)
Why you keep on shootin' if you know that nigga dead? (Skrr)
That's the only kind of shit that gets you some respect

Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no hoe (ayy, ayy)
Every month, she don't even love me, she just puttin' on a front
She gon' try and settle outta court and make a run
Then gon' ask me how I'm doin'?

I'm upset
Half a million on my head I can accept, yeah
'Least it makes me feel like someone tried their best, yeah
Want to waste a half a million, be my guest
Made me wanna buy a vest and a TEC (skrr)
But I'm blessed, I just checked
Hate me, never met me in the flesh
Said she's got somethin's she gotta come here and collect
That shit is in a box to the left, to the left

Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep trynna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no hoe


Too rich for who? Y'all just got rich again
Who grips the mic and likes to kill they friends?
I never been the type to make amends
If shit was at a eight we like to-we like to-we like to-
Yeah, if shit was at a eight we like to make it a ten
1da sent this in, I'm going up all the way
I don't like to talk when there's nothing else left to say

Drizzy by the drop, the game is in disarray
I'd tell you hear me out but we both know end of the day
Your sister is pressin' play
Your trainer is pressin' play
Your wifey, your wifey, your wifey

I gotta breathe in real deep when I catch an attitude
I got a whole 'nother level that I can tap into
Max said they only bless when they attached to you
The only deadbeats is whatever beats I been rappin' to
And the product is still the best though
It's only good in my city because I said so
Just the 50 estate man, I had to cop a feel like presto, voila, tada

Never a matter of could I or should I
Kiss my son on the forehead then kiss your ass goodbye
As luck would have it I've settled into my role as the good guy
I guess luck is on your side
I guess luck is on your side
All sevens, no sixes
Rest easy get some shut eye
Hold on, hold on
But I miss makin' 'em pay
Helipad from Will Smith crib straight to the stage
Three forum shows, but I played Staples today
The neighborhood is smokey, y'all stay safe in this place

Drizzy 'bout to drop, the game is in disarray
I'd tell you hear me out but we both know end of the day
Your niggas is pressin' play
Your nanny is pressin' play
Your wifey, your wifey, your wifey, your wifey

Had to go and hit reset, now we here
I been on top for three sets of three years
I can't be around the niggas you minglin' with
I can't fly if I can't sit on the wing of this shit
Try to pay it less mind
They been keepin' tabs on me like I be payin' next time
I think I sense a little fear from the other side
White vans parked across the street, real subtle guys

Yeah, never a matter of could I, should I-
Kiss my mom on the forehead, then kiss your ass goodbye
As luck would have it I've settled into my role as the good guy
I guess luck is on your side
I guess luck is on your side
All sevens, no sixes
Rest easy get some shut eye
Hold on, hold on
But I (haha)

But I can't argue with you
No! You mad!
Look at you! You mad!
You big mad! (hahaha)
I'm happy!
Leave me alone!

A lot of money

No! Who is you?
You ain't nobody
You mad!

Knock you off to pay their tithes
They want me gone but don't know why
It's too late for all that lovey-dovey shit
I'm your brother shit, all that other shit

It's too late for all that, ayy
It's too late for all that lovey-dovey shit

Lead the league in scorin' man, but look at my assists (shh)
Yes I be with Future but I like to reminisce (yeah)
I do not forget a thing, I'm patient, it's a gift (yeah)
Try to tell 'em they ain't got to do it, they insist (they insist)
Yeah, I can tell
I just gave them two for $40 million like Chappelle (two)
Standing over coffin with a hammer and a nail (two)
Heard you hit up so and so that name don't ring a bell

Sick of these niggas (sick)
Sick of these niggas (sick, sick)
Hire some help, get rid of these niggas
I'm sick of this shit (sick, sick)
I'm runnin' a blitz
Whatever you did, it is what it is

Ayo blast that shit back
Blast that shit back if you blastin'
Ayy

UberX to Hidden Hills, give me somethin' I can feel
If they come to Hidden Hills then I know they know the deal
We just right there up the road, you could hit it wit' a stone
I be out here on my own, I'm just tryna set the tone
I've been kicked when I was down, none of that shit matter now
Niggas think they run the town 'til we run 'em out of town
And they gotta relocate, gotta defend where they stay
Everything will be okay, man just stay up out my way

Skit around ends with the bros and I'm kitted to the toes
If I touch studio then we got one
I be tryna laugh with the bros 'bout the opps that we know
But they can't take a joke, 'cause it's not one
Think it's 'cause we live by the code, reputation to uphold
Makin' me the one they gotta take the spot from
I be tryna laugh with the bros but they can't take a joke

Ayo blast that shit back
Blast that shit back if you blastin'
Yeah, yeah

Back and forth to Italy, my comment section killin' me
I swear I get so passionate, y'all do not know the half of it
I grew up with the reps, them boys be crashin' it and splashin' in
And when I say they crashin' it, I do not mean a accident
I'm- I'm still in the studio at 6:45
And my haters either on they way to work or they arrived
And I gotta own the things I rap about just for my pride
You know when it comes to pride, I can't put that shit aside
I've been kicked when I was down, none of that shit matter now
They be throwin' in the towel, I do yellowtail Ital
They be watchin' what they say, especially when it's to my face
Everything will be okay, man just stay up out my way

Skit around ends with the bros and I'm kitted to the toes
If I touch studio then we got one
I be tryna laugh with the bros 'bout the opps that we know
But they can't take a joke, 'cause it's not one
Think it's 'cause we live by the code, reputation to uphold
Makin' me the one they gotta take the spot from
I be tryna laugh with the bros but they can't take a joke


No more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
No more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, ooh
Yeah

Niggas see the crib and ask who did I steal from
Price tags on making the world feel some
They don't have enough to satisfy a real one
Maverick Carter couldn't even get the deal done
Niggas scared to come towards us, gotta run from us
Louisville hush money for my young gunners
Rick Pitino, I take them to strip clubs and casinos
Stack of c-notes get all you niggas scratched like Preemo
Worms, I just opened up a can of those
My mother had a flower shop, but I was Sandra's Rose
Two girls that I rope like I'm Indiana Jones
I make them hoes walk together like I'm Amber Rose
Yeah, fuck that I got to up the ante
California girls sweeter than pieces of candy
Had me all up on a Nipsey hood and go link up with Sammy
Type of hood where bandanas make niggas a family
Head on a swivel, I could shoot but I could never dribble
Life too short I gotta get it 'fore they blow the whistle
My uncle tried to change the energy with stones and crystals
But it's gonna take more than that for me to control my issues
I wasn't made for no casket or no prison cell
Every title doing numbers like I'm Miss Adele
Sandra knows I pulled us out of a living hell
I'm the chosen one, flowers never pick themselves

No more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
No more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, ooh

Niggas want a classic, that's just ten of these
Crime family like the Genovese
You don't want drama, capisce?
My house is full of supermodels just like Mohamed Hadid
I take this shit too serious, you niggas my comic relief
I find it funny how I keep on talking and commas increase
I'm standing at the top of where you niggas are climbing to reach
I even got my very own initials inscribed on my sheets
Subtle reminders are key, Gs
Spoiler alert: the second act is tragic
And everyone that wants the worst for me's asking what happened
Backstabbed so many times I started walking backwards
Like Charlemagne, I see the light and see the darkest patches
Bury me and I'll be born again
I walk in godly form amongst the mortal man
I got some real demons across the border fence
And made a note of the mistakes we can't afford again
Like I said, can of worms and I'm the early bird
Niggas want to hang but I'm too busy doing dirty work
Hit 'em back and say we'll link back on the 33rd
When I say that they cursing me, it ain't dirty words
Church of Pentecost, Holy Spirit synagogue
I don't know who's protecting me but we hit it off
Sandra's rose, no wonder they tryna' pick me off
I guess you gotta show these niggas who you really are

No more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
No more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, ooh


Ayy, ayy
Lot of 6's in here tonight
Yeah, yeah
Ayy

Ten of us, we moving as one
I'm so proud of who I've become
You might think I've taken some lumps
Only if we talking 'bout sums, yeah
Intentions are pure, they cannot tell me relax
My mentions are jokes, but they never give me the facts
This isn't that, can't be ignoring the stats
Based off of that, they gotta run me the Max
They gotta run me the Max, they gotta double the racks
They had it set up for real but they didn't come with the slaps
When I heard the shit I was skipping through that
If I get it trippin', it's no coming back
I don't understand, these niggas gotta adapt
You know where I'm at, I put the six on the map
Your shorty was bent, she wanted to vent, I promise it fell in my lap
My money is young, my problems are old, I promise I'm bridging the gap

You know what I'm sayin'
Ayy, ayy
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'
(Gyeah, gyeah, gyeah, gyeah)

Niggas provoke, this shit ain't a joke, man, nobody playing
He's at the top and he's at the top, but nobody staying
These niggas around but they ain't around, you know what I'm sayin'?
Say that they down, when they shit is down, you know what I'm sayin'?

Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'
Ayy, ayy
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'

Yo, get close enough to HOV smell like a kilo still
First album 26, I ain't need no deal
Already a hood legend, I ain't need no shine
First Rollie flooded out, I ain't see no time, woah
Stand up niggas, we only ducking indictments
Dope boys, off-white, looking like soft white on 'em
You know what I'm saying?
We in the building, we came for a billion, ain't nobody playing
Live every word that I'm rapping, say I lost ninety two bricks and it happened
You probably wouldn't believe everything that you seeing right now if it wasn't live action
I ain't on the 'Gram, they record who I am
God to these dope boys, how do you not be a HOV fan?
I'm what Meech should have been, I'm what Supreme didn't become
If Alpo didn't snitch, niggas'd be like Young
I got your President tweeting, I won't even meet with him
Y'all killed X, let Zimmerman live, s-s-streets is done

You know what I'm sayin'
Ayy, ayy
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'


Only holdin' up I do is my end of the bargain
Only beggin' that I do is me beggin' your pardon
Only tryin' that I do is me tryin' the hardest
Only problems I do are math problems with profit
Only lyin' I do is lyin' out in the tropics
Only cryin' I do is cryin' from laughin' 'bout it
Only lackin' I can do is my lack of responses
Only rest that I do is "Where the rest of my commas"
Still I rise, Maya Angelou vibes
When life comin' at you from all angles and sides
And they don't wanna see that you smilin' from inside
It really boils down to how you plan to survive
Love certain ones but never get attached to 'em
Give 'em nice things, but what's that to 'em?
Especially when another girl I flew in is flickin' up in my bathroom
And they recognize the bathroom
All hell starts to break loose in my texts
I only tell lies to who I gotta protect
I would rather have you remember me how we met
I would rather lose my leg than lose their respect
But that'll never happen the way I'm watchin' my step
That ain't what I'm 'bout
I'm in control of my destiny, never in doubt
If I can't make it with you, I'll make it without
They say take the good with the bad, I'll take it without
Houston women I wine-and-dine and take to the house
My moral compass is janky, it breaks in the south

Is there more to life than digits and bankin' accounts?
Is there more to life than sayin' I figured it out?
Is there more? Yeah

Sweeter the berry, the blacker the juice
The boy is back in the booth, ready to tap in the truth
Too many lyrics 'bout houses and loot
Too many Walt Disney characters, mouses and goofs
I mean you know I love a challenge, but challenged by who?
I'll let you bring a thousand recruits
My peers are a talented group
But even if you take all their statistics and carry the two
Even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops
There's still nothin' they could really do
It's too bad reality checks don't cover the balances due
Whenever it's time to recoup
Yeah, soon as this album drop I'm out of the deal
In the house playin' D'Angelo, "How Does It Feel?"
I got a fear of havin' things on my mind when I die
What you got? Time on your hands or time on your side?
Is there any sense in doin' these songs when I'm high?
Is there more to life than goin' on trips to Dubai?
Yachts on 4th of July, G5 soarin' the skies
Is there more to life than all of these corporate ties
And all of these fortunate times
And all of these asses that never come in proportionate size?
Am I missin' somethin' that's more important to find?
Like healin' my soul, like family time

Is there more to life than just when I'm feelin' alive?
Is there more?

Passion, instant
Sweat beads, feel me (feel me)
Cupid's shot me
My heartbeat's racing (my heartbeat's racing)
Tempt me, drive me (tempt me)
Feels so exciting
Thought of highly (highly)
It's yours entirely
I'll be, I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than your lover for you


Treat you like princess, rest in heaven Diana
Piquing my interest, she got peak like Montana
England breeds proper girls; where are all your good manners?
Reply with pleasantries
Honestly, I can't stand ya

Ohh, ohh
You gon' make me turn up on you
Ohh, ohh
You gon' make me turn up on you

What you thought of me
Never had me missing a beat
That's just a view from a cheap seat
They don't want problems with me
Talk used to be cheap, nowadays it's free
People are only as tough as they phone allows them to be
Girl, that could never be me
I found my peace, I'm about to say my piece
You might not agree with me

Ohh, ohh
You gon' make me turn up on you
Ohh, ohh
You gon' make me turn up on you

What I'm sayin' in today really are big, big A's if you're gettin' betrayed on right now and you leave it there for a couple weeks, they should know this is the girl I kinda want to see so drop off the tea, bro, 'cause the world nowadays ain't like that. Shady. He is... did that  obviously it takes time  you tryna shoot facts? Well, you shouldn't have any problem should you at the beginnin'...  That's what I said, that's what I said! The beginning is always hurried. Yeah, well you overdo it and he's overdoin' it. Both of you are overdoin' it right now. Yeah, well, alright


I think you're changing your mind
Starting to see it in your eyes
I used to love a good surprise and now
I'd rather know ahead of time
You said "I love you" too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started and we're already done

Yeah, you say I led you on, but you followed me
I follow one of your friends, you unfollow me
Then you block them so they can't see you liking someone just like me
I expected more from you honestly
Said you want a simple life and that's not me
How you go from that to ending up with someone just like
How can you be angry on a night in July
And be warm with me when it's freezing outside
You're confusing me
Don't have me wasting my time
Yeah, you said "I love you" too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started and we're already done
I kept you decent, I kept you sane
I kept it peaceful don't lie
I kept it decent, even the secrets
Kept it between you and I
Breaking my heart, tearing me apart
Breaking me down when I'm already down
Breaking my heart breaking my heart breaking my heart
Breaking my heart breaking my heart
Brea Brea Brea Brea Brea Brea Brea Brea
Breaking my heart, tearing me apart
Breaking me down when I'm already down
Breaking my heart breaking my heart breaking my heart
Breaking my heart breaking my heart
Brea Brea Brea Brea Brea Brea Brea Brea
Brea Brea Brea Brea Brea Brea Brea Brea

You said "I love you" too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started and we're already done
How can you be angry on a night in July
And be warm with me when it's freezing outside
You're confusing me
Don't have me wasting my time
You said "I love you" too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started and we're already done


Ayy, yeah
Dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
Yeah

Leaving me (leaving me)
Dippin' out on me (on me)
Already got what you needed, I guess
Quickly (quickly) learned yourself through me (through me)
Already gave you what you needed, I guess (ooh, yeah)
I guess, (yeah) yeah
That's why I'm not with nobody (ooh, yeah)
'Cause I don't wanna hurt nobody (ooh, yeah)
Did it over text, didn't call me (ooh, yeah)
Still got love for you, mami
I know you wanna be somebody (body)
Even if you gotta leave somebody, yeah

Yes I'm hurting, yes I'm jaded (jaded)
Most of these things, I don't wanna say (jaded)
I wanna be around while you chasin' (while you chasin' it)
You wanna hit me up when you make it
You'll try and come back when you famous
I always want the truth, but it's dangerous (dangerous, oh)
You got something real, not basic (ooh, yeah)
You wanna get with me, stop
Yes I'm hurting, yes I'm jaded (jaded)
Most of these things, I don't wanna say (say)
I wanna be around while you chasin' (wanna be around, wanna be around)
You wanna hit me up when you make it (ooh, yeah)
You'll try and come back when you famous (back around, back around)
I always want the truth, but it's dangerous (dangerous)
You got something real, not basic
You wanna get with me, stop (playin')

Yeah
Dogs on this side, dogs over on this side (ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
Ayy
Told me about all your insecurities, for what?
Dragged me like two hours to your family's house, for what?
Said you need some time, but I should stick around, for what?
Always felt like stickin' 'round's the same as being stuck
And like guns with the inkin', you're getting under my skin
Pretty little young thing (young thing)
Had a nigga convinced, got me too excited
Yeah
You played me
You played me, you played me
Low down, dirty
Shameful, crazy
I need to know how the new nigga you got does the same thing
I do for a living but is way less wavy
How you even managin' to keep straight faces in all the pictures that I seen lately
Lord knows you still look amazing
That's besides the point I'm making
You're way too opinionated, have to force it, have to fake it
You have potential, I could've shaped it
You went and caved in (ooh, yeah)
We could've waited
I wasn't rushing
Differences in ages
You're old enough, but you're still a baby
You've shared stories where you did amazin'
Things to be loyal, things to be patient
That was before me, I must've changed it
Shifted your focus, lens lookin' jaded (jaded)

Most of these things, I don't wanna say
I wanna be around while you chasin' (while you chasin')
You wanna hit me up when you make it
You'll try and come back when you famous (back around, back around)
Dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
You wanna get with me, stop (playin')


I wanna know who mothafuckin' representin' in here tonight
Hold on, hold on

I keep lettin' you back in
How can I explain myself?

Care for me, care for me
You said you'd care for me
There for me, there for me (Lil Weezyana shit)
Said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me (Murda on the beat)
You said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me
Why won't you live for me?
I keep letting you back in
How can I explain myself?
Care for me, care for me

There for me, there for me

Said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me (Yeah)
You said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me
Why won't you live for me?

Everybody get your mothafuckin' roll on
I know shorty and she doesn't want no slow song
Had a man last year, life goes on
Haven't let that thing loose, girl, in so long
You've been inside, know you like to lay low
I've been peepin' what you bringin' to the table
Workin' hard, girl, everything paid for
First, last phone bill, car note, cable

With your phone out, gotta hit them angles
With your phone out, snappin' like you Fabo
And you showin' off, but it's alright
And you showin' off, but it's alright
It's a short life, yeah

Care for me, care for me

There for me, there for me
Said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me
You said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me
Why won't you live for me?

That's a real one, in your reflection
Without a follow, without a mention
You really pipin' up on these niggas
You gotta be nice, for what to these niggas
I understand, you gotta hunnid bands
You got a baby Benz
You got some bad friends
High school pics, you was even bad then
You ain't stressin' off no lover in the past tense
You already had them
Work at 8 a.m., finish 'round five
Hoes talk down, you don't see 'em outside
Yeah, they don't really be the same offline
You know dark days, you know hard times
Doin' overtime for the last month
Saturday, call the girls, get 'em gassed up
Gotta hit the club, gotta make that ass jump

Gotta hit the club like you hit them mothafuckin' angles
With your phone out, snappin' like you Fabo
And you showin' off, but it's alright
And you showin' off, but it's alright

Why won't you live for me?


Yeah
Turn everything up
Yeah, oh yeah
Turn everything up a little more

I want my baby to have your eyes
I'm going against my own advice
Should I do New York I can't decide
Fashion week is more your thing than mine
I can't even lie
I'd rather stay inside
I can't do suit and tie
Can't be in a room with you and stand on different sides
One thing at a time
I have to learn to hide
One thing at a time
Emotions running high
I wish you felt alright

Just hitting my line
All the time, all the time, all the
You stay on my mind
All the time, all the time (yeah)

It takes some finesse
I seen you finesse
He can't know finesse

You stay on my mind
You and your sister
Too hot to handle
Things will get cancelled
I would make time for you
Commitment
Going the distance
I'm new to all of this

It takes some finesse
I seen you finesse
He can't know finesse
You stay on my mind


It's your fuckin' birthday (oh, birthday, happy birthday)
It's a fuckin' celebration (oh oh)
Tonight we celebrate
Seems like time's out of our control
It's a celebration, oh oh

It's your birthday, baby, it's your birthday, yeah
Who's gonna love you on your worst day?
You talk so tough, I know you're soft like buttercups
Reese's, Reese's, don't be ridiculous
Just say your piece and peace up like Ibiza
Cool your headtop, you hotter than Anita
Bakin', baby, tell me where I need to-

To be, to feel, and fill
That emptiness inside you
Petty bullshit shouldn't excite you
On your birthday

It's your brrrrrrr-
It's your fuckin' birthday (oh, birthday, happy birthday)
It's a fuckin' celebration (oh oh)
Tonight we celebrate
Seems like time's out of our control (oh oh)
It's a celebration, oh oh

They tried it, they went for it
All year and you're still here, just ignore it
If it ain't the real thing, you don't want it
GG, CC's all on ya
It's your month and you know it (and you know it)
And you know it's real, don't gotta say it for you
And you know somebody home prayin' for you
You say, "Play this shit," they better play it (ayy, play it)
For you (for you) on time
And I miss the days that you was all mine
Haven't been official in a long time
So tell me where I need to-

To be, to feel, and fill
That emptiness inside you
Petty bullshit shouldn't excite you
On your birthday

It's your brrrrrrr-
It's your fuckin' birthday (oh, birthday, happy birthday)
It's a fuckin' celebration (oh oh)
Tonight we celebrate
Seems like time's out of our control
It's a celebration, oh oh

Oh, it's your fuckin' birthday, oh, oh


Yeah, woo

Way that you lookin' all the time
Time gets to tickin' and it takes a toll
Told you I couldn't really draw the line
Line ringin', sayin' that you told him things
Things that you could've kept inside
Sidetrackin' me when I was good to you
You were somebody I would stand behind

I know you like to drink 'til the sun up
Grind 'til you come up
Work all winter
Shine all summer
Ride for your brother
You die for your mother
Keep that shit a hunna
I know you wanna
Vacay to a place where you could
Take pictures, post on Insta'
Your friends say they miss ya'
But they don't really miss ya'

Rule number one, to be a boss ass bitch: (uh-huh)
Never let a clown nigga try to play you (okay)
If he play you, then rule number two (okay)
Is fuck his best friends and make 'em yes men (okay)
(Wow, that's how you feel?)

I'm just in the cut sittin' sideways
Way that you lookin' all the time
Time and it left you with a broken heart
Hardly excuses how you play with mine
Mindin' my business and you show up
Up to no good, I should've seen the signs
Signin' me up to do your dirty work
Workin' to try to get you off my mind

I know you like to drink 'til the sun up
Grind 'til you come up
Work all winter
Shine all summer
Ride for your brother
You die for your mother
Keep that shit a hunna
I know you wanna
Vacay to a place where you could
Take pictures, post on Insta'
Your friends say they miss ya'
But they don't really miss ya'

Trap, TrapMoneyBenny
This shit got me in my feelings
I just gotta be real with it, yup
BlaqNmilD, you a genius, you diggin' me?

I don't even care, I need a photo with Drake
Because my Instagram is weak as fuck
I'm just being real, my shit look


Ayy, wild things you're doin' at night
Trips to wherever feels right
Doin' it all just to feel things
Drinking's enough of a vice
Drugs just aren't suiting you right
You were just fine as a real thing, thing

You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me

All of a sudden you say you don't want me no more
All of a sudden you say that I closed the door

It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say

I can't recover from our last conversation
You called me weak
And you tested my manhood as we yelled at each other
You wanted me to gon' put my hands on you
Just to show you I love you
You know I can't jeopardize both our reputations
Despite what you say
Despite what you choose to do with yourself this summer
You're actin' out, you know you love to see me down
Stressin' over somethin' (stressin' over somethin')

You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me

All of a sudden you say you don't want me no more
All of a sudden you say that I closed the door

It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say

Girl, you love, you think you broke it
I'm leavin' you today, you broke my heart
Girl, you love, you think you broke it
I'm leavin' you today, you broke my heart


Haha, haha
Yeah, ayy
(After dark)

In a whip so low, no one's gotta know
Knocking at your door, I don't gotta work anymore
You can put your phone out here girl, you need two hands
You can't get enough, girl, you know I set it up for after dark

Late night, like left eye
I'm creepin', assuming the worst 'cause I haven't heard from you all weekend
Your silence is driving me up the wall, up the wall
I cannot tell if you're ducking calls or missing calls 'cause
You've been so patient
I drink on the job and smoke on the job
So I don't know how serious you take it
Can't offer much more, you've heard it before
That narrative for me isn't changing
I wanna make you a priority
I wanna let you know there's more to me
I wanna have your faith restored in me
I'll be on my way

In a whip so low, no one's gotta know (no one's gotta know)
Knocking at your door, I don't gotta work anymore (I don't gotta work no more)
You can put your phone out here girl, you need two hands (ooh, yeah)
You can't get enough, girl, you know I set it up for after dark

Late night, me and you, got you wet like the pool
Then I'm tryna dive in, put some time in, yeah
Get the vibe right, get your mind right, it's gon' be a long night (ooh yeah)
Put your feet in this water, don't wanna get your hair wet
We've hooked up a couple times, we ain't took it there yet
You broke up with your man and ain't been with nobody else
You like, "Fuck these niggas," rather keep it to yourself
He did you wrong, he left you down bad
Now you can't trust nobody
You said, "Do anything, but just don't lie to me"
I said I ride for you, girl, you said you ride for me
Umm, pulled up to the shorty, we got drugs
And when it's time to duck it, we can go

In a whip so low, no one's gotta know (no one's gotta know)
Knocking at your door, I don't gotta work anymore (I don't gotta work no more)
You can put your phone out here girl, you need two hands (ooh, yeah)
You can't get enough, girl, you know I set it up for after dark

In the loving embrace of my storm on BLK


Yeah
I never really talk about dick that I wanna give you
Or places I wanna get to
Neck grab, head grab
Arch back, heart attack, cardiac
I need it nasty like
Like Evil Angel, like Vivid
You know, nasty like how they give it
You know, I need you to be open like Kay's kitchen
That pussy kinda sound like waves hitting, soothing
Keep it right there, no moving
Make my way around the bases
I wanna take you to oasises
Bein' honest, I don't really know what patience is
Ayy, freaky like the red leather Michael
Zombie revival, this ain't like you
This that new you, this ain't high school (high)
I like best when you're fresh faced and no foundation
Willing and ready for the taking
Earth shattering, groundbreaking
Head scarf for after our relations
No judgment is our arrangement
Make that face up if you dare, but just be prepared that
I am gonna cause that lipstick to smear
And the mascara tears to run down
I always need a glass of wine by sundown
I always get your ass over here somehow
I hope that the apocalypse is the only thing that doesn't come now
Well, what now?

Did somebody  who'd they say that baby look like?
Drake!

Cashed out, my neck is frozen
Careful when we're mixing potion
Slashin' like Guns N' Roses
You got options but I been chosen
To deal with you the way you like
The way you like it
To deal with you the way you like
The way you like it
Oh, you
Cashed out, my neck is frozen
Careful when we're mixing potion
Slashin' like Guns N' Roses
You got options but I been chosen
To deal with you the way you like
The way you like it, yeah


Here we go
Yeah

Yesterday morning was crazy
I had to come to terms with the fact that it's not a maybe
That shit is in stone, sealed and signed
She not my lover like Billie Jean but the kid is mine
Sandi used to tell me all it takes is one time, and all it took was one time
Shit, we only met two times, two times
And both times were nothing like the new times
Now it's rough times
I'm out here on front lines just trying to make sure that I see him sometimes
It's breaking my spirit
Single father, I hate when I hear it
I used to challenge my parents on every album
Now I'm embarrassed to tell them I ended up as a co-parent
Always promised the family unit
I wanted it to be different because I've been through it
But this is the harsh truth now
Fairy tales are saved for the bedtime stories I tell you now
I don't want you worry about whose house you live at
Or who loves you more, or who's not there
Who did what to who 'fore you got here
Now, look, I'm too proud to let that come between me and you now
Realize I got to think for two now, I gotta make it, I better make it
I promise if I'm not dead then I'm dedicated
This the first positive DNA we ever celebrated
I can't forget the looks on they faces
Got the news in Miami that we all now got ones that we raisin'
Tell Gelo bring some, uh, Ros and Baccarat out for our cheers to the next generation
But this champagne toast is short-lived
I got an empty crib in my empty crib
I only met you one time, introduced you to Saint Nick
I think he must've brought you like twenty gifts
Your mother say you growing so fast that they don't even really fit
But man, you know, I still had to get it for my boy though, you know
You haven't met your grandfather yet, that nigga a trip
He probably coulda did stand-up
But at the same time he's a stand up
And that's how you gonna be when it's time to man up
October baby for irony sake, of course
I got this 11 tatted for somebody, now it's yours
And believe me, I can't wait to get a hunnid more
Sorry I'm vintage, tryna cover ground
They said that in two weeks you're supposed to come in town
Hopefully by the time you hear this me and your mother will have come around instead of always cutting each other down

God willing, I got a good feeling
You got a good spirit
We'll talk more when you hear this
My G

No one to cry on
I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain
To ease the pain
I'm changing from boy to a man
No one to cry on
I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain
To ease the pain
I'm changing from boy to a man
I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain
To ease the pain
I'm changing from boy to a man


Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)

I got car money, fresh start money
I want Saudi money, I want art money
I want women to cry and pour out they heart for me
And tell me how much they hate it when they apart from me
Yeah, and lately I do bitches the meanest
Tell 'em I love 'em and don't ever mean it
We go on dates, I send the Maybach out in neighborhoods
They never seen it
That shit is dangerous, but it's so convenient, I ain't lying
Yeah, and comfortable I sit
That manual Ferrari Italia's some fly shit
It's sitting at the house like I bought it in '96
'Cause honestly I'm too fucking busy to drive stick, I swear
Too fucking busy, too busy fuckin'
This nigga girl, but to me she wasn't
Been hot before they open doors for me, pre-heated oven
I'm in this ho
But I ain't finished though, it's been a minute though
My newest girl from back home got issues with parents
And some charges, how the fuck can I get her to Paris?
Luckily, I'm the greatest my country's ever seen
So chances are I get the border to issue me clearance
Dreams money can buy
Everybody yelled "Surprise!", I wasn't surprised
That's only 'cause I been waiting on it, nigga
So fuck whoever hating on a nigga
Of course

Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)

Food from India, she in Charlotte Olympias
We talked music for hours, she never mentioned ya
Can't tell you how much I love when niggas think they got it
And I love the fact that line made 'em think about it
YMCMB
These niggas make it so hard to be friendly
When I know part of it's envy
Tryna fill the shoes, nigga, so far, these are empty
I take 'em off in the house because the throw carpets are Fendi
Ooh! I never seen the car you claim to drive
Or, shit, I seen it; you just ain't inside
And I feel like lately, it went from top five to remaining five
My favorite rappers either lost it or they ain't alive
And they tryna bring us down, me, Weezy, and Stunna
We stayed up, Christmas lights in the middle of summer
And if the girl standing next to me got a fat ass
Then I'll probably give her my number
Yeah, I throw my dollars up high
And they land on the stage you dance on
We got company coming over
Would it kill you to put some pants on?
Dreams money can buy
They told me it's like a high, and it wasn't a lie, yeah
Just have some good pussy waiting on a nigga
And fuck whoever hating on a nigga
Aw, yeah

Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)

Don't
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me
Don't


Call up on drank and let's
Let's call up um

All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'mma sip until I feel it, I'mma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older somebody should've told ya

I'm on one
Fuck it, I'm on one
I said I'm on one
Fuck it, I'm on one
A strong one

Two white cups and I got that drink
It could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money that we got, and I'mma get that shit

'Cause I'm on one
Fuck it I'm on one

You know what I like,
Oh yes, oh yeah
Oh yes, oh yeah
Oh yes, oh yeah

You know what I'm sipping, I'll teach you how to mix it
But you're the only one, 'cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches
They might catch me slippin'
So you're the only one, 'cause I don't trust these bitches
They might, they might catch me slippin' and put in something different
So you're the only one 'cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches
They might catch me slippin'
So you're the only one

Trust issues

Let's call up on drank and let's all get wasted
On drank, let's all get faded

Drizzy Drake, check me out
Coming live from the motherfucking North Side
Kick game, run game, run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sittin' court side

Same nigga that you knew way back when
You actin' like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me how the fuck we supposed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show

I could tell, I could tell, I could tell
Certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more
Guess that they don't really make 'em like me no more

You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
'Cause if ya what I created then I hate myself
But still, let them girls in,
And tell 'em all leave their cell phones on the table where we see 'em
I'm all day with it man, AM to the PM
Niggas hatin', I just wish that they would say it when I see em all

That's that shit that drives me crazy
And it's all that I've been gettin' lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women wanna fuck like they're me and I'm them
Looking for some things and I think that I can find them in you, in you

Trust issues
Trust issues
Trust issues

Let's call up on drank and let's all get wasted
On drank and let's all get faded
Call up on drank and let's, let's call up and


Why you keep askin' me about her?
She's not here right now, she's not here right now
Why am I the one you wanna get into it for the drama?
I got a lot to say, and that's the last thing a nigga wanna hear right now

Spendin' all my days on the Eastside
Forgettin' who I was on the other side
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now
Tryna put the power in my own hands right now

I'm about to ride through the old 'hood right now
Got too much pride for my own good right now
Waitin' on you to give in and hit me up
So I could fall through like old times and hit it up

I'm terrible at inviting myself, call me over
Those nights when you need someone else call me over
You can be the one to take control call me over
When I get there, you already know, call me

Why you keep askin' me about her?
Couple of other things I'd rather do than talk about that right now
Told you about giving him chances on chances on chances
He's not holding you down, he's holding you back right now

Spendin' all my days on the Eastside
Forgettin' who I was on the other side
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now
Tryna put the power in my own hands right now

Love it when your ass speak the truth to me
Tryna wake up and have you with me
Waitin' on you to give in and hit me up
So I could fall through like old times and hit it up

I'm terrible at inviting myself. Call me over
Those nights when you need someone else. Call me over
You can be the one to take control. Call me over
When I get there, you already know. Call me

I threw my hands in the air and said show me something

Remember one night I went to Erykah Badou house
She made tea for me
We talked about love and what life can really be for me
She said when that shit is real you just know
And I was thinking about you, you already know

The other night Chubbs showed up at my house
He had weed for me, that's my nigga 'til we gon'
Keeps his ear to the streets for me
Said the city stress him out on the low
I said, "I feel you, nigga, I already know."

Already
Girl's talkin' bout you, gotta leave already
Damn, my lil' nephew turned four already
Gave you a little help, you need more already
Damn, you need more already?

'Fore you said, "You're mine," I was yours already
22, had the Bentley 4 door already
Even as a boy I was the boy already
So you know that mean the pussy galore already
Mention other girls, you get insecure already
That was in the past, I've matured already
Fuck them hoes, you got the award already
You go to Chanel and get the rewards already
Know I do this shit for 3rd Ward already
Know I do this shit for H-Town already
Already, already

Back up in this thing, it's a go
Had a couple niggas out of pocket, now they know
Ain't the first time 'cause I've lost you before
Had to get it back, had to get it back

Had to pull it back because I know I'm on the road
Had to take you back because I know you're down to roll
If you can get it from me, you can have it, now you know
All your friends asking where you stand with the boy

FaceTime saying you got plans for the boy
Studying your body, that's exams for the boy
Take a flight here, pop a Xan for your boy
Waking up in Amsterdam with the boy
Long flight home, another Xan for your boy

You would probably fly out to Japan for the boy
You would probably kill another man for the boy
You would probably
You would probably lie 'bout it on the stand for your boy
Put the Bible to your right hand for the boy
That's why you I ain't never got to worry 'bout the boy

You know you got
You know you got that really good insurance on the boy
You just gotta pack a bag and hurry to the boy
Why?
Fring


Draft day, Johnny Manziel
Five years later how am I the man still
Draft day, A. Wiggins
Fuck that other side bitch we stay winnin'
Aww man, you know I had to do it for you
You know I had to do it for ya
Yeah, suits and ties yelling out "pay the guys"
Man I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
Aww man, aww man, aww man, man
You know I had t

Sometimes I laugh with God about how you can't stop me
I'm his darkest angel probably but he still got me
I'm gettin' mine but still I better lives
And shit I set aside to make sure my people are gettin' by
Brunch with some Qatar royals and my cup is all oil
You know it's real when your niggas will take the fall for you
All loyal so you keep egging me on
And we gonna have to crack a shell just to prove to you, you ain't hard boiled
Last night I tried some raw oysters
Man that boy growin' up quick, that boy know he the shit
That boy singin' on every song when he know he can spit
That boy manifested it, that boy knew it was written
That boy did it on purpose
That boy know that they shittin' on you, and they can't get past you
You should've followed all my moves, you won't realize 'til after
And if I left shit to chance I would've picked a name like Chance the Rapper
No offense cause I don't know that nigga
I'm focused on makin' records and gettin' bigger
Just hits, no misses, that's for the married folk
Tell 'em fix my suite up cause I'm comin' home
I heard they talkin' crazy, I was out of town
You know they love to pop all that shit when I'm not around
But when I'm here, not a sound
That'll make me snap, jot it down
Go in the booth and lay a body down
Know some Somalis that say we got it wallahi
Get us donuts and coffee, we'll wait for him in the lobby
And I gotta tell him chill, Sprite got me on payroll
Let that man live, they say "Okay if you say so"
See whatever I say goes
I play like I'm on 'roids, no Canseco
No Oakland A's though, shout out the Bay though
I think I'm on my eighth flow, just watch me paint flow
We all do it for the art so I can never hate though
Signin' off on more deals than a lawyer with a heavy case load
How the game turn into the Drake show?
Dog, what the fuck happen to so and so, where did they go?
They too worried 'bout bitches and fashion, they go missin' in action
And then you never notice they missin'
On some Hunger Games shit I would die for my district
Jennifer Lawrence you can really get it
I mean forreal, girl you know I had to do it for yah
You know I had to do it for yah
You know I had to
Oh wait sidebar, left some beat at the end
So that all of you fuck niggas could loop it and get your lies off

Draft day, Johnny Manziel
Five years later how am I the man still
Draft day, A. Wiggins
Fuck that other side bitch we stay winnin'
Aww man, you know I had to do it for you
You know I had to do it for ya
Yeah, suits and ties yelling out "pay the guys"
Man I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
Aww man, aww man, aww man, man
You know I had t

Thats why I dont read the news, its garbage
And the editor that wrote the thing, hes garbage
Got guys on my back about schedule, saying its too tough
Well guess what?
Its Division-1 football!
Its the SEC!
Heck, you pledged, didnt ya?
Go play intramurals, brother
Go play intramurals


Yeah
All you self promoters are janky
We established like the Yankees
This whole fucking game thank us
We movin' militant but somehow you the one tankin'
No limit to where I can take it
And you know me as a Cris bottle sender
Check picker upper
I thought we looked out for one another
Saw us all as brothers in the struggle
Too blessed to be humble
I guess it's different in the city I come from
All the sudden I got people showing how much they truly resent me
They whole demeanor just spells envy
They tryna tempt me
The higher I get, the less they accept me
Even had the OG's tryna press me
Ha-ha-ha-ha
No way out cause I'm already in it
I'm not attending when I do a show and get a ticket
Good business can clean millions, I got the vision
I been had it since No Scrubs and No Pigeons
Even back when I wasn't as poppin'
When they told me take an R&B nigga on the road and I told 'em no and drew for Kendrick and Rocky
I tried to make the right choices with the world watching
"Mike never tried to rap like Pac
Pac never tried to sing like Mike"
Those my dad's words to me when I asked him how to make it in life
And I always said my mother gave the greatest advice
Look at me now, they look at me like the golden child
Can't nobody hold me down, especially not right now
Certain shit just too wild to reconcile
Take that, take that no love in they heart so they fake that
DiCaprio level the way they play that, damn nigga, what is that
Y'all don't hear no songs then hit my phone like you did that
And you even hit my line like where you been at
It's always on some shit like when can I get a favor
Or where my bitch at, like I'm about to tell you where she been at
Costa Careyes, I got her kidnapped
She ain't sorry and I ain't sorry, it's too late for sorry
Green, White and Red on my body cause I'm dipped in Ferrari
All she wanna do is get high and listen to PARTY
She complain, I tell the driver to drop her at Barneys
My summer diet is just Ros and calamari
Look now you got me started
I'm the black sheep, rest in peace to Chris Farley
I got a lot to lose cause in every situation
I'm the bigger artist, always gotta play it smarter
Y'all shook up, I'm here on the cookup
Cameras pointing every time I look up
That's why I gotta duck behind Chubb shoulder just to hit the Kush up
Sponsorship dollars is sky high
He be like, "Drake, will you please stop smoking la la?"
Chubbs, why try, I'm a thug, I'mma die high
Got the Rose pink tinted lenses, it's a Wednesday
Architects takin' dimensions, they redoin' the entrance
Yeah, redoin' the entrance
Kinda like when you drop on some again and again shit
And you still never quite get it
Meantime Drizzy over there, tryna make you
Make you dance to this, yeah I make you dance to this
I rode big body, widebody, Calabasas road winder
Sunshinin', waxed tires
See Kris Jenner, I beep twice and I wave
The rest of you boys I blow Keysh right in your face
Pistol by my bed, I'm sleep but I'm awake
For that one night you niggas try to reach inside my safe
Don't push me cause I'm way too uneasy nowadays
These guys move so greasy nowadays
I tell you my life and y'all don't believe me when I say it
Save my stories for down the line, I'm too ahead of the curve every time
Just total the hits and see what you find
You SWV cause you weak and I'm always always on your mind
Yeah
And we can't stop
Make you dance to this
I'mma make you One Dance to this
A-ha-ha-ha-ha
Bod breed bod bwoi


Yeah
This on some "old Tommy Campos Dice Roll" shit
For my niggas, though

You underestimated greatly
Most number ones ever, how long did it really take me
The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me
So they never take shots, I got everybody on safety
I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards
You probably wouldn't lose a single rapper
Niggas make threats, can't hear 'em over the laughter
Yeah, that's cause I'm headed to the bank, nigga
Sinatra lifestyle, I'm just being Frank with you
I mean, where you think she at when she ain't with you
Wildin', doin' shit that's way out of your budget
Owl sweaters inside her luggage, you gotta love it
Damn, this shit could go on a tape
Bitches lovin' my drive, I never give it a break
Give these niggas the look, the verse, and even the hook
That's why every song sound like Drake featuring Drake
Tr8, Y pree? Why is it always me?
Got us watchin' our words like there's wire taps on the team
Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggas
Guess it's funny how money can make change outta niggas
For real
Some nobody started feelin' himself
A couple somebodies started killin' themself
A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf
I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin' to help
I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation
Bad press during the summer over allegations
I ain't lyin', my nigga, my time is money
That's why I ain't got time for a nigga who's time is comin'
A lot of niggas PR stuntin' like that's the movement
And I'm the only nigga still known for the music
I swear, fuck them niggas this year
I made Forbes list, nigga
Fuck your list, everything's lookin' gorgeous
Without me, rap is just a bunch of orphans
But if I stay in the shit, there's a bunch of corpses
And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans
Stashin' money like hoarders off multi-platinum recordings
Eat it like Im seated at Swiss, Sotto, and Joso's
Nothing Was The Same, this shit for Easy and Cocoa
This shit for Kareem, this shit for Jaevon
This shit for Julius, Milly Mill
Boy we do this shit for real
All them boys in my will
All them boys is my Wills
Anything happen to pop and I got you like Uncle Phil
Weezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill
If anything happen to papi, might pop a nigga for real
Comin' live from the screwface, livin' out a suitcase
But I'm feelin' good, Johnny got me pushin' two plates
My weight up, I refuse to wait up, I started a new race
It's funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe
Niggas treat me like I've been here for 10
Some niggas been here for a couple, never been here again
I'm on my King James shit, I'm tryin' to win here again
A young nigga tryin' to win here again
Man, what's up

Yeah
A young nigga tryin' to win here again
If I like her, I just fly her to the city I'm in
I got her drinkin' with your boy
I got her fucked up, shorty
Aww yeah


Waited on you for so long
Too many days since January
I'm still sitting here alone
We shoulda did this already
Said I gotta email today
Kinda thought that you forgot about me
But I wanna hit you back to say
Just like you, I get lonely

Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too
Just like you, I get lonely too
Just like you, I get lonely

Ready for us to get it on
Ain't got a love to call steady
Hope it ain't like that for long
I'll be your friend if you let me
Don't wanna come on strong
'Cause too many people wanna get me
But you know I do what I gotta do
Just like you, I get lonely too

Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too
Just like you, I get lonely too
Just like you, I get lonely

Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too
Just like you, I get lonely too
Just like you, I get lonely

I get lonely
I get lonely
Just like you


Yeah.. 26 on my third GQ cover
Your new shit sound like you do covers
On all of my old shit, oh shit; I devoted to making sure 
That shit goes unnoticed; swear you niggas is hopeless
I should run a clinic for niggas that think that they're winning
On some coach shit, 50Ms for a three month road trip
I see straight through them like fish tanks with no fish in them
Drizzy still got some '06 in him
IRS all in my books getting they Matlock on
All this capital it's like I left the caps lock on
It's like every time I plot a return I seem to shift the game
See I can still talk keys without pitchin' cane
Pay yourself and owe yourself; before you come to my city 
Just know yourself, know where you at
I'm good in every town, I'mma be there doing shows where you at
The lights hit women screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga

But thats, thats where all this, thats where the feeling is
Thats where all that shit comes from man I mean like
The music that you and I used to listen to ahh.. was just..
Absolutely phenomenal, because we went through it all
We went through errythang; I remember you loved Jodeci
I mean like studied, you even made me a CD

Yeah, your money is just a little Barneys Co Op for you to be tryna show out
I'm in your girl's ear planting seeds like a grow-op
We move the operation to Cali soon as the snow drop
Oh stop, please stop arguin' 'bout who's the best emcee
I think everyone would agree, they know that you're not
I know I'm a sure shot, middle finger poking you in your sore spot
Bars sound like I'm under oath nigga
I comedy central roast niggas and turn 'em to ghost niggas
Either I'm gettin' bigger or you're just gettin' smaller or it's both nigga
I'm just as unforgivin' as most niggas
You bit the hand, now starve, it's not a joke nigga
I'll hang you with it after I teach you the ropes nigga
Oh well, bitches paint OVO on their toenails
And show up at the show, the afterparty, and the hotel
That five star in your city, they know where we at
I hit the lobby, women's screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga

Jodeci's back
bitches screamin' like Jodeci's back
I call the front desk for condoms, she's sayin' they ain't got none
The way that I'm respondin', she know that we black, nigga
(Fuck you mean?) Jodeci's back
Fuckin' hoes like Jodeci's back
I paint pictures and flip words
Nigga woulda thought Def Poetry back
Cole...

Roof top, hoes turnt up
Lookin' for your bitch, bet she won't turn up
Wonder where she is, fuck could she be
She's a ho, she's a slut, she's a freak
Heard a couple niggas hatin' but them fuck niggas weak
Count a hundred thousand dollars like it sucks to be me
Ain't that what you wanted? Stuntin' on you niggas
Came in this game never frontin' on you niggas
Gave you heart and soul, stories of my pain
Feel naked cause I laid out all my glory and my shame
Caught fire just to have niggas ignore me and my flame
'Bout to burn down the house, they tryna put me in the rain, no
Fuck your list you lame niggas and doubters
I'm undoubtedly the hottest and that's just me bein' modest
Go check the numbers dummy, that's just me gettin' started
I'm artistic, you niggas is autistic, retarded
Started, hold your applause
Who gives a poker face when you jokers showed me your cards?
David and Goliath, takin' on the giants
No need for pause when I tell you my balls bigger than yours, Cole
No false gods, young Mike playin' against the Monstars
Tappin' into '94 Nas
Or that '96 Jay, or that +Chronic+ shit, Dre
Which is really just Slim Shady, I'm silly, my pen crazy
Today I'm out in Philly, my fans waitin' for twelve hours
Just to get their dollar signed; thoughts stream like I'm Spotifyin'
Trenchcoat flow, bottom line
To these too cool for school niggas I'm Columbine
Flow dumber than your projections
This makes twice now, I doubled what you expected, yet
Your covers keep perplexin' me
Maybe it's too complex for me
But is this 'bout skills or is this 'bout sales?
Cause either fuckin' way, man all them niggas is less to me
You legends know that we rap
Bitches screamin' like Jodeci's back


They say that all of yo old girls got somebody new
I say, "damn really? even Rosemary? even Leanne Seely? "
They said, "fuckin right, they were the 1st to go
It's nothing personal
It's just that all of them women you slept on were working though,
They was saving up
New niggas came around, they've been waking up with,
I swear, you don't know this city anymore
They might've loved you before
But you're out here doing your thing
They don't know you... "
Sure they do they're just not as sincere
It's crazy all the emotions forgot in a year
She like, "why you even give a fuck you not even here"
Well out there there ain't nothing for me, and I think I need to come home,

Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think you got to me
I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where,
I am right now
But believe I remember it all

I be with my nigga chubbs
He in love with street shit
No wonder why I feel awkward at this fashion week shit
No wonder why I keep fucking up the double cheek kiss
Along for that ignorant Young Money, Miami beach shit
A couple of artists got words for me, that's never fun
They say it's on when they see me, that day don't ever come
I'm never scared, they never real, I never run
When all is said and done, more is always said than done
And I was told once, things will change,
By a nigga named tip when my deal came
Told me it's all good, even when it feels strange
Now I'm the guy that know strippers by they real names
Rochelle, Jordanne, thick bitches, they just talked me out of 4 grand
How did a pile of kush become the mountain of truth
How did a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth
Damn, my biggest fear is losing it all
Remember how I used to feel at the start of it?
And now I'm living a muthafuckin fairy tale
And still trying to keep you feeling a part of it
Yea, just lie to my ears,
Tell me it feel the same, it's all I've been dying to hear
Lights get low, and that's when I have my brightest ideas
And I heard my city feel better than ever,
That's why I gotta come home,

Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think you got to me
I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where,
I am right now
But believe I remember it all

My mother is back to who she was years ago
It's like a new page me and her are beginning on
I wish she stopped checking up on women I can't stand
'Cause I got new girls I could use her opinion on
She thinks I've become a slave to the wealth
But I'll never break the promises I made to myself
And I would never make up names for myself
Then change the names, that I just gave to myself
Certain rappers would call me to say, "wat up doe"
I used to brag about it to my friends, and now I'm feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat
And maybe that's all they do, is just pretend, damn
But I bought it though, I believed it
Yea, I thought it, and I achieved it
Yea, so show me love, show me fucking love!
'Cause I thought it was all I needed
Yea, Clearly I was wrong about it all along
And this will be the year that I won't even feel shit
They trip about the amount of people I brought along
But I'm just trying to be surrounded by some real shit
Need credentials for everyone of these Toronto kids
I promise they see it with me, we just tryna live
I told 'em we bout to get it, and we finally did
Listen closely to my shit I swear it sounded like home

Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think you got to me
I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where,
I am right now
But believe I remember it all


Tat my name on you girl so I know it's real
Tat my fucking name on you so I know it's real

Tell a bad bitch girl, let's go hang
You know me, rolex, gold chain
Fuck my young niggas, XO gang
Get so drunk you forget yo name
Incense, burning, smoking out to my own shit
Got black wood in my white Range, I'm taking off when that light change
I'm Drizzy Drake to my old bitches, Voodoo child to my new hoes
I miss this and I want it back, So I'm all in with these new flows
New flows, got new flows, rap is stress but it pays great
Pimp flows 'n screw flows, my shit be sounding like grape tapes, now
Lemme go an hit that cup, 1 time before a nigga hit that road
These days keep going by too fast, so give me anything that make shit go slow
Yea, money in my safe, but I'm living dangerous
They told me shit would change, but I don't really see no change in us

Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fucking name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, But I ain't tryna hear it
'Cause when I'm not around, I'll still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, yea, you'll still be mine
Tat my fucking name on you, when I go you'll still be mine, yea
You'll still be mine, yea, I'll still be yours
Tat my fucking name on you, let em know you love the boy, wassup

I fondle the money, fornicate with a fortune
I play with her mind, she masturbate with my Porsche
It's simple love, it's simple math
Her chest nice, not a wrinkle in her ass
Puffin' purple hash welcome to my power circle
Sucker free, no snitching, and we know when cowards working
Rolls Royce rollin', rose gold rollie's
MBA accountants, amounts they get unholy
But mama still praying for her rubberband man
When them wheels land, Travis Barker drums playin'
Tap dance to my drum roll, I love a bitch that know to keep me one rolled

Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fucking name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, But I ain't tryna hear it
'Cause when I'm not around, I'll still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, yea, you'll still be mine
Tat my fucking name on you, when I go you'll still be mine, yea
You'll still be mine, yea, I'll still be yours
Tat my fucking name on you, let em know you love the boy, wassup

I don't have to work in the morning so I always stay for 1 more
Fuck what they say, I'm telling you there's no side effects I'm sure
Went from driving up on some old shit, to drivers opening doors
This is my town, if you need something just ask for it's yours
Yea, ask for it's yours, if you ask for it it's done
I could Western Union some money, get your passport and then come
You'll meet everybody I know, at first it might seem like a lot
But they're all playing their role, Put that on everything that I got
And all I care about is my city, man I can't say it enough
I done heard things about y'all that they can't say about us
I just hold it down for my side, I just hold it down for my sect
I give everybody a piece of this, and I make due what's left
Yea I do this shit to the death, yea I do this shit till I'm gone
Yea, I told you that it's our world, and you're foolish thinking I'm wrong, OOh
Stop asking how the fucking needle feel, tat my fucking name on you, let these niggas know it's real, wassup

Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fucking name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, But I ain't tryna hear it
'Cause when I'm not around, I'll still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, yea, you'll still be mine
Tat my fucking name on you, when I go you'll still be mine, yea
You'll still be mine, yea, I'll still be yours
Tat my fucking name on you, let em know you love the boy, wassup


All the school kids are so sick of books and learnin'
They don't read anymore, they don't even read anymore
They just wanna be like all the rappers that I can't stand
Niggas we don't need anymore
All the niggas we don't need anymore
And all the cops are still hangin' out at the doughnut shops
Talkin' 'bout how the weather's changin'
The ice is meltin' as if the world is endin'

She asked me
"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?"
She asked me
"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?"
I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap if you think we really need one I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Everything straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment

What are we even doing?

Ridin' clean
With you on my mind and I'm thinkin' dirty things
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord
I've seen some things
I wish we had met when I was in my teens
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord
Cause these days I only know conditional love
I'm not used to settlin' down
I'm too used to switchin' it up, oh
And she says, "you don't know how good it is to be you cause you're him"
And I say "well, goddamn"

Then ask myself
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?
I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap if you think we really need one I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment


Look, I know girls love Beyonc
Girls love to fuck with your conscience
Girls hate when niggas go missing
And shawty you ain't no different
These days it's hard to meet women
Feel like my love life is finished
I've been avoiding commitment
That's why I'm in this position
I'm scared to let somebody in on this
No new friends, no no no
You know how this shit go
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like it's just me, but I am not alone
But if you're alone then, say my name, say my name

Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, Baby, I love you
If you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you

Yeah
Uh
Say my name, say my name
Cause those other men are practice
And this ain't no time for actin'
And this ain't no time for games
And this ain't no time for uncertainty
And this ain't no time for locking your phone and not coming home
And startin' some shit when I'm in the zone
This is why I've been saying
No new friends, no no no
You know how this shit goes
This is not four years ago
Time escapes me
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys round me saying, Get money and fuck these hoes
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with
Cause we don't wanna hide no more
Plus you're not shy no more
Neither of us wanna play the side no more
No, I'm not alone
Even though nothing was the same
Let me get your ass alone
Let me make you say my name
Say my name

Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, Baby, I love you
If you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you


(Can I, baby? Can I, baby?)
Yeah, (can I, baby? Can I, baby?)

(Can I) bring you to the six where I really stay, (baby?)
Show you why I am the way I am
(Can I) tell you what I think my biggest flaw is, (baby?)
I try to be consistent, but I can't
(Can I) have an honest moment wit' you right now, (baby?)
Tell me who the fuck you want to be
(Can I) get an honest answer from you right now, (baby?)
'Cause all we ever talk about is me
(Can I? Before I turn the lights out)
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be
(Can I) call instead of text you on the hotline?
Sometimes a nigga wanna hear your voice
(Can I) see you right now, I know the sun is up, (baby?)
Sorry, I don't really have a choice
(Can I) ever make you feel like I'm down for you, (baby?)
You do so much more than that for me
(Can I) finally take the time and open up to you, (baby?)
'Cause that's the side you never get to see
(Can I? Before I turn the lights out one more time)
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be

(Can I, baby? Can I? Before I turn the lights out
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Can I? Before I turn the lights out)
Tell me who the fuck you wanna be
(Can I? Can I, baby?
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Can I? Before I turn the lights out one more time)
Tell me who the fuck you wanna be
(Before I turn the lights out)


For my nigga Hush
Yeah, look

Dressed in fatigues, I rep the East with my trustees
Smokin' on crushed leaves
They turn they back on everything we built, then they must bleed
I've seen splatter hit the snow when the blood freeze
Straps over territory they know we must keep
Get home and white Air Forces get brushed clean
Back when my mama would interrupt sleep
To tell me hurry up 'cause the bus leaves
Summertime heatwaves, I used to just cut sleeves
My shorty really love me, man, she want me to cut keys
I can't do that normal type of life, is it just me?
Niggas steady try to ride the wave, but it's rough seas
I'm losin' enough sleep dealin' with envy
And the news that they sent for me got the block in a frenzy
It's on Meech like it's trendy
Runnin' round from Laurier to MacKenzie when the city's empty, yeah
Early twenties, but I want fifties, hundreds, not pennies
I need plenty
Got me ready to flip the F out like Fendi
Whatever's in me, it's takin' over
I gotta bust it down, break it open
Until somebody starts takin' notice, then we rollin'

Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'

Look
Back when Big Apple sold dreams, I stuck to my own thing
Back when the house that I own now was my home screen
Before I'd ever hit the road and feel like the home team
Runnin' missions
Pyramid schemes just like the Egyptians
Back when hotlines were still flippin'
Now I'm seein' money off of hotlines blingin' but it feels different
Transitions, plans switchin', ambition
Mindin' my business, buildin' a business, et cetera
Inspired by a few, but my mind really drives itself like Tesla
I always had a little somethin' extra
Back when Corey was our sole investor
And the car could get from A to B, but won't impress ya
Look, I ain't no baller
Still need my accounts longer like the way my nephew's gettin' taller
My soundtrack is the second Carter, dreamin' of acceptin' offers
And easin' tensions
Keepin' family out of East Detention
And out of Pine Hill Funeral Center
Spots we got no business enterin'
Back when Jill Scott was the apple of my afrocentric eye
I had to find a way to get someone's attention

Then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'


Yeah, somebody on
Somebody hit me today and they were like:
"Nah, just make sure, you know
You tell me what to do when I get there, you know?"
June, you're a genius
I said, I respect it, no problem
I got all these blessings, just to give it to others anyway
Know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, my hand's always open, for real

Ayy, thirty-three years, I gave that to the game
Thirty-three mil, I save that for the rain
Five hundred weeks, I fill the charts with my pain
Five hundred mil and I fall back in the 6ix
Finally give you niggas the space you need to exist
Michael Jackson shit, but the palace is not for kids
Still women sayin' it's childish the way we live
Brought a few Ws to the 6ix
Baby mama fluke, but I love her for who she is
Baby, Wayne and Tez responsible for this shit
Half the time, I question my consciousness in this shit
Other times, I question if compliments are legit
Full-time, I'm out here confident as a bitch
Tryna make good on the promises that I give
Tryna make sure my accomplices are legit
Register the business in my brother's name
Thirty-five hunnid in the pocket, that should cover things
Certified loverman, trappin' out the motherland
Always move right, so my watch is on the other hand
She can try and play it down now, but she was a fan
People wanna know what's in my pockets, they don't understand
My assistant always findin' Percocet and rubber bands
Know my mom might not want to hear how I discover plans
Word to Sandra Graham, no one love you like your mother can
I watched Michael Rubin win a million off a couple hands
I decide what to see next like it's on demand
I decide what to be next like I'm switchin' plans
I'ma tell you what you feel next like the weatherman
I will split heads and break necks for my little man
6 God, praying hands like I'm a religious man
But I'm just a sicker man (Six, six, six), wicked man
Look, we can argue back and forth, but who the richer man?
Isn't that what matters in this world that we livin' in?
Bank notes, dividends, snakes stay slitherin'
How you plan to make it to the top by just fittin' it?
How you plan to take a nigga's spot by just givin' in?
How you gon' treat this shit like you gon' get to live again?
How you gettin' hype off one hit? Do that shit again
How you got a manager you met after you got the win?
Bet you got some niggas that'll love you to the bitter end
Bet you got somebody that's just smarter than your other friends
Give 'em a percentage, see what happens to your blessings then
You just need to stay close to your people
That was there when others could've been
Than when others should've been
Got a nigga starin' at the game like, "Damn coach, put him in"
But you never listen, so you niggas going wood again
Got us in the crib, talkin' 'bout what niggas coulda been, shoulda been
And I got your girl on the second floor, beggin' me to put it in
And it's not because all of the money that you wouldn't spend
And it's not because I set it up to try and get revenge
It's because you niggas insecure, you ain't made men
It's because, even though you hate on me, we stay friends
It's because you niggas never learn when to say when, yeah

For real, facts, you know what I'm sayin
Haha, yeah

I even took that day, I even Drake
That handsome man, who is the king, Drake, yes
See him? Which means people from back inna di days me comin' from far with dem mandem Drake, Kardinal Offishall, nuff ah dem
So you know Drake from time then? Yeah man
Okay because I know when he keeps like a party and stuff
He wouldn't invite you guys, compain and stuff
Yeah man, in the six, yeah man, dem man out there right inna Drake video, man, right beside Rihanna man
That's right, that's right
And I respect that because, um (Yeah)
A big lion like him didn't have to remember, you know?
So that was a nice time (Yeah)
But what mi ah try show you is the people dem ah say "Ah, Drake is not here, guy"
Y'all can get, shut up, dawg

What are- what are they doin' (I don't know)
Can you still have some, "He's wack guys"
"He ain't hard," and when ya a hot fiya
You have water, you have piece of water?
"Hard and soft," funny, stop it
That mandem is the king (Haha)
I don't care


Two thirty baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?

Presidential suite, on deposit
Elevator up to the room
Shower up and then we hit the club
Touchdown, gotta see what's up
Area code in my phone
What numbers do I still have?
Who do I know from the past?
Hit one, she say she got a man
Hit another one, it goes green

Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then I'll sit my drunk ass on that runway
On this one way

Stickin' on your backstage pass
All access 'cause you bad
You could go wherever with that ass
Show, to the shower, to the truck
Truck, to the club, for the party
You go in first with your girls

Hurtin' deeply inside
First time in a long time
Hurtin' deeply

Trust

Watchin' my back even when I'm in the booth
Oh, trust who?
Doin' my thing 
But I'm down to come clean, not like you

Not you
Oh, just save it
Don't waste your time
'Cause I'm wavy and I'm sayin' things
That I don't mean, but I do mean
And I don't want you to miss me
'Cause there's no way that you're sorry
And you're crying and you're sayin' things

You was everything a nigga need
You was everything to me, (my love)
Why you keep that little shit from me?
Left me down on bended knee
When I scooped you in the Maybach
(The only time a nigga ever made you take a backseat)
Why you do that little shit to me, shawty?
When you know that we was meant to be
Why'd you keep those things from me, my love? Love
I've given you enough time

Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)
'Cause you got desires

You got that fire and I'm not a liar
You had me down on my knees everyday, had to talk to Messiah
I'm in that '81 and this that '82, this a different Ferrari, yeah
I tried to pay all your loans off and cop you a driver, yeah
I had you stayin' too close to the city
You actin' too vulnerable livin' this life
I shoulda moved you away from Houston
Before I copped you all this ice
You wanna be my number one, you're not actin' like the main thing
I let you play my number two, you barely made the second string

I should have put you somewhere where no one could find you (Find you)
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)
'Cause you got desires

Ayy, self-control has never been your thing
Don't think it'll help if there's ring with a rock in it
Where I'm from they serve, the soda gleam (Gleam, gleam, gleam)
You come from a city where there's lean with the rocks in it
How the fuck you keep so many secrets?
How you goin' vegan but still beefin' with me again?
How the fuck you've seen so many beaches?
Tickets to them places don't come cheap
And I see you back in Turks
Remember who took you there first and don't you forget it
Got you a whip then you got back on your shit
I had to tell Eric to go get it
I'm always movin' too fast, the feeling don't last
I feel like you take me for granted
Probably my fault for the way that I handled it

I should have put you somewhere where no one could find you

'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)
'Cause you got desires

Ooh, shortie you tried it
Voice gettin' filled with entitlement
Why would you tell me those lies? Oh
Why would you make it so bold to my face?
Why are your stories all over the place?
Whole lot of secrets friends don't keep safe
Where did your friends all go? (Woo)
I can't solve your problems
You say your problems never needed solvin'
I was too good to you, shoulda stayed silent
Nice guys always finish off where they started
Deja vu, you wanted things and you got 'em
Deja vu, I wanted smoke and I got it
Deja vu, deja, deja


Yeah, I'm outside in an AMG
Right outside, TT
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me, yeah
Still with the dawgs that I grew beside
All the niggas 'round me ride or they die
Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by
I'm outside in an AMG, yeah
Right outside, TT
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me
Who am I? All the niggas 'round me ride or they die
Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me

I just caught a shawty off a finsta
Just threw on a hoodie, it's a Crenshaw
Way that I been livin' unconventional
I'm just tryna make it to the end, ya know
Certain things just started gettin' tenser
Think we need to have us an adventure
I could be your man but maybe down the road
Right now I would rather see my heart turn to chrome
Rather see my heart turn crystal
I can't even front like I don't miss ya
Right now I'm just stuck inside the crib on my own
Soon as I free up, I'm 'bout to pop up on your phone like

I'm outside in an AMG

Yeah

Heart's still on javelin, baby
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me
I was pullin' off 'fore they knew me
Sometimes I wish there was two of me or three of me
When it was you and me
I felt like I love you too much to change you
You believe in angles more than angels
Feel like I've been going through too much to explain to you
But I'm still the same way I was when I came to you
Everything I have, what I had to exchange for you
Everything I've been through, I can't even complain to you
Wish it stayed the same for you, sorry
I'm sorry

And-and-and-and

Hey, Instagram
This song I've been writing, oh, for a few months
I don't know, I, I started writing it about family
Just came up now, so
Anybody feel any way about it, I don't give a fuck
(Yeah, family)

Yeah
Yeah
Lost you to the game, I gotta hug that
I was here when you was asking where the love at
Dip your finger in the bag to get your buzz back
I was wishin' on a star when I was that
I've been fortunate enough to have it my way
I'm a fortune teller, listen to what I say
'Member when we used to park up in my driveway
I always told it how it was, I never shy away
This life is really something you get lost in
I know niggas that got famous and they bought friends
I had friends that only had half of they heart in
It's hard to accept now, and it was hard then
But I treated you like gold, I was all in
Spoiled rotten, they could smell you 'fore you walked in
Burnin' incense in your new apartment
But you got no sense when it come to
Lost you to the game, I gotta hold that
How you feelin' in your soul since you sold that?
I'll be better off without you, and we know that
You ain't lookin' at a nigga you could hold back
Like I'm tryna show the waves, this is no cap
You sold me up the river, but I rowed back
You put me on the road without a roadmap
I'm not tryna make no song, these are cold facts

You got some liquor at the house?
(Yeah)
Go get a shot, let's do a shot together
(I don't see it)
(Okay, hahaha)

Ayy
Being here wasn't in the plans
I do it for the Grahams, not the 'Gram
I do it for the fam, but still fuckin' Uncle Sam
I tried to change for you, but that wasn't who I am
Even when being real is out of fashion
Niggas keep stealin' my style, now we out here matchin'
I did it by being myself with no dramatic acting
I couldn't sit around and wait, I had to have it happen
Lost you to the game, I gotta face that
Really think I lost you like a ways back
Always sayin' how a nigga never play fair
I took you up under my wing and you just stayed there
You was supposed to grow some wings, get your own pair
We started this from the bottom, now you alone there
Shit, you treat it like it's home there
Dependent on me, you was supposed to get your own share
I still love you to my last days
I never knew that shit would be this fast-paced
I never thought I'd see awards in a glass case
I could've ended up in your crib with a masked face
It could've went left on a couple bad days
When I visit my last place is the only time I'm in last place
See me these days, I never got on a sad face
See me these days, I
Lost you to the game, and I see why
It was always you and I without the T-Y
This is not one of them stories that got three sides
This is not one of them stories you could rewind
Like I'm tryna show the waves, this is no cap
You drove a nigga crazy, but I drove back
You wrote me off and then you never wrote back
I'm not tryna make no song, these are cold facts

Yes, sir
(Baby)
Hold on, hold on
(Let me tell you something about me)
(I really do know, I know who I wanna be)
Woo
Lord, I already passed on all that (Woo)
You go 'head on, haha

When I linked with Mexiko, I knew I found a plug (Dro)
Rest in peace to Static, yellin' "Shawty want a thug," ayy
Bottles in the club, ayy, know I love to touch (Ayy)
Weezy played that shit for me and Kobe on the bus
Went and got a chain for me, I had to give it up (Yeah)
Niggas had they pistols loaded pointed at my truck, ayy
And you know that lesson stuck (Right)
From that day I never touched the road without a (Plugg)
Ayy, from that day I never saw the point in talkin' tough (Nah)

Rappers that I threw an alley-oop are throwin' subs (Yeah)
But they gotta dap me when they see me, that's what's up (That's what's up)
I let that shit slide, I got everything
I could lose it all if I'm reactin' to the petty things

YMB the gang and they down to stain anything, mhm
Yeah, that's right
YMB the gang and they down to stain anything, mhm

Bottles in the club, ayy, know she wanna fuck (Ayy)
Weezy played that shit for me and Kobe on the bus
We ain't even get to reminiscin' what it was (Yeah)
Moral of the story is the story finished us
Damn, and you know that lesson stuck (Right)
Haven't left the 6ix in like a month (Ayy)
Fuck that, I'm here, baby, where the love? (Nah)
Fuck that, I'm here, baby, just because (Yeah, yeah)
I would never leave, but I could, though (6ix)
Yes, I know I leave you, not for good, though (No)
Same way you could diss, but you wouldn't, though
'Cause you know good and well that I'm

Booted up, turned up, piped up (Plugg)

Woi-oi, ayy

I don't cop things for resale, don't do iCloud, don't do email
Feds wanna tap up man and wire up man like Chubbs did Detail
Back when Ricky was doin' up Teesdale, I was doin' dinner with Teezy
I didn't trust no one, swore I got a lie, niggas got too greazy
Niko never move neeky, sweatsuit Nike, sweatsuit DG
If man get beaky, ring ring, call up GiGi, do him up neatly
Used to look up to a man from certain ends with tune on repeat
Thought he was a bad boy, then 'til man got pinched and man went PC
Man went PC just like Dell and Windows, some man been those
Before I was ever around Kendall's, I was at ends though, dreamin' up Enzo's
The woman I do end up with has to be a bad girl just like Munchy
Can't have no pretentious ting when I know this road gets bumpy
Word to the broski Jay, he got different names in different countries
Three waps in the whip, when we beat that case, where man live way too comfy
I don't do well with people makin' disses or makin' threats
Woi-oi, man got flown like private jets, for way-way less
I know you tryna get one down on us ever since then it's been stressed
'Cause you know the reps dem owe you one and we always pay them debts
Wassa, wassa, just like the crodie Pressa, I don't do no passa
Link with Scull and cousin Jamie hard, ah yard and we deh pon Gaza
Pasha Sasha pissed, I was way too young at the time for slashings

The LV pouch on chest is just for fashion, niggas just actin'
Are you dumb or stupid? The wheels on the Rolls is Chromazz, headshot domazz
Just checked in at the hotel floor that we all got potent aromas

As for the rest of the game, I'll do man dirty, man'll get two time
To me, that's just our side, I don't really care who rides on whose side
Ring ten shots to the poolside, never seen none of these grown men outside
4301 won't spare no one, niggas gotta know about Southside
Steppin' outta line, get outlined, ain't North, tied up stateside
Bringin' man down when they take sides, tryna get saved by the bell like Bayside
Prince I carry that last name, that shit stays on me like brand names
Jas just lined up brand new hand tings and nice guy on a madting
Everyone I know has code names, anyone I'm beefin' with is a no name
Niggas can't even win home games, they just gotta fall in line like Soul Train

Niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf nigga
Oh, Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shout-out to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up
The six ain't friendly but it's where I lay up
This shit a motherfucking lay up

Been cookin' with the sauce, chef. Curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man we really with the shits, boy
Really with the shits
I should probably sign a Hit-Boy 'cause I got all the hits, boy

Fuck all that "Drake you gotta chill" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
Yeah, I'm on some rappers pay my bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to money mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't wanna make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh, Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billi's, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOAT's for it
Ugh, I run this shit, they like "Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh, Lord, who else sounded like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready
Fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show
Valuable lesson, man I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit

Whole squad on that real shit

The other night, Lavish Lee told me
That I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how I feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if it wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I can see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften it
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how I was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real


Who else really trying to mess with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G though
Treating Birmingham just like my Hollywood shows
I'm trying to tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to lose
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
We hit the strip club, and all them girls find a pole
I live fast die young, never take it slow
Tell your girl to tell a friend that it's time to go
And tell me today's weather
I know they say they good, but trust me I'm better
I sound like the coldest Miami night ever
I'm cold but still hot you can't decide on a sweater
Really it's whatever
I am murdering and this is so amusing
If they're a sight to see then I am an illusion
I tell you I'm the man baby what is the confusion
And if they still sleeping on me, someone hit the snooze then
And keep sleeping while I sell a couple million
I'm headed for the moon, I ain't bout to hit the ceiling
I'm about to hit the club, women tell me I'm appealing
But fuck what they say let me tell you how I'm feeling
I'm drinking
These London street lamps got a real glow
Dizzy playing driving fast but it feels slow
And ask your man, he a hater, baby, he don't know
I could kick a punt and turn that shit into a field goal
This here was meant to get buried
I got a lot of things, I mention those barely
I ain't lying to the kids like the dentist ain't scary
I'm what Lebron was to Saint Vincent, Saint Marry
But I ain't playing high school games
Pullin McLarence through a McDonalds drive through lane
I'm to fly, I keep it hip hop like Afu-Ra
Baby girl on that Mclaren
You gotta lift the doors
Blades chopping through the city streets, liquid swords
I do it better than the best could
You know what it is, Drake and Tim Westwood


Let's get it. I can't wait to trick man
It's gonna be so sweet

Summer mine

Stay true never switch sides, yeah, the game turn me into this guy
Yeah, and now every time Drake out, cameras always flashing tryna put me on the Takeout
Crib in Calabasas man I call that shit the safe house
Thirty minutes from L.A. the shit is way out
Woop, but these days that's where I'm stayin'
You can hear it in my voice I'm goin' way in

She loves to get on, she loves to get two

You're so thoughtful you're so thoughtful
You're so bad girl, you're so awful
I fuck you right in my office
You go tell your friends you're honest
That's why all your friends are on
You know you made me a promise
We're not in this for commitment
Your man's gone and you don't miss him
Book you flights and confirmation
Southwest Airlines you'll still take it
Hell of a week for you chasing that paper
Even though you're exhausted you're still gonna make it girl
You're so thoughtful you're so thoughtful
You're so thoughtful you're so thoughtful
You're so thoughtful you're so thoughtful
You love to get to him

And you know, and you know, and you know
And you know that I put you on
And you know, that's something you know
And you know, you love to get two on


Yeah uh yeah
These are my one St Thomas flows
Me and my niggas and some Madonna hoes
That look just like virgins
But trust they down to go
Discussin' life and all our common goals
Smart kids that smoke weed, honor roll
Look how the champagne diamonds flow
Fine dining, pour another another glass when the wine is low

Im in the crib stackin' money from here to the ceilin'
Whatever it is I got is clearly appealin'
These other rappers gettin' that inferior feelin
I hope you feel it in your soul spiritual healin'
Take a look at yourself the mirror's revealin'
If you ain't got it you ain't got it the theory is brilliant

People ask how music is goin' I heard it pays
I just came off makin' 2 million in 30 days
Damn I guess it does what the message was
Sometimes I feel I be spendin' my money just because
But weezy I'm just out here reppin' us
Till I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessin' us

Yeah, I know these niggas miss the mean lyrics
Kush got the room smellin' like teen spirit
I asked kindly if no-one out here would bring there feet up
Until I lose for now I'm the game's single leader
I fly private so no-one tells me to bring my seat up
And book a suite when me and your favorite singer meet up

Who you like, tell me who it is
Imma make sure that that women is the next one on my list
I should call it a night but fuck it i can't resist
This one is for all my niggas from my city tryin' to diss
Without a response from me you really fail to exist
And I love to see you fail that feelin' there is the shit
I swear, aghh pussy nigga get your bread up
Enjoy the seat that the steward just forced your ass to let up
Why your scary ass lookin' down pick your head up
No-one told you your disguise is the most ridiculous gettup
With nose plugs in now I can smell a set up
So your just wastin your time your just only makin me better

Yeah I try to tell them don't judge me because you heard stuff
Chasin' cash that's my brother from the surf club
Damn that nigga always kept it so hood
Back when we would smoke good
At the oakwoods
And have girls fall through like coins in a couch
Now we just fuckin all the bitches they warned us about
Scared for the first time everything has clicked
What if I dont really do the numbers they predict
Considerin the fact that I'm the one that they just picked
To write a chapter in history this shit has got me sick
But if I really do it dont expect to get a split
Cause this truly is some shit I don't expect you all to get

Im nervous but I'm about to kill it cause they about to let the realist team in
Throwin up in a huddle nigga Willie beamin
Were still throwin touchdown passes
And tore his frame glasses
Hopin that someone catch it
People say that oh drake we started to miss it
But they need to be a little more specific
Man is this what yall want?

And my best Chris Tucker impression
Ducking your questions
Fuck your suggestions
Money gets all of my love and affection
Cars all black like the cover of essence
I'm allergic to comin in second
But I never sneeze
Nigga YMOE nigga yeeah

Uh, yeah, this want yall want
Octobers Very Own
Young Money

Thank me later in this bitch wasssup
Free Weezy in this bitch wasup

Diamonds hang around my neck, the crib is all finished
No love for these bitches I said this year its all business
It is a shame that a couple of em are off limits
No offence to my nigga, its just the industry is small
We all lust for the same women
You know the ones we saw before we came in it
I know he ain't trippin
I know I got a couple things that Lil Wayne dipped in
Ain't ashamed to admit it, I be the same with it
This shit is all about hits and misses
The ones that you fuck and the ones that you wife up
Dont let them fuck your life up
Half a mill to perform, I cant let them fuck that shit up
Plus I love the way my middle name looks when its lit up
Jim Moore got me dressing like a leading man
A little favour for a friend when I need a hand
Young Frank, suits cut right always
Just got a couple Warhols for my hallways
New verses crush the hood like Im driving into something
Bitches on the kid like Im Iverson of something
Like a Sixer, since I sold 680 in my first
Drizzy Drake, the only one that got the gift without the curse
Swag!


Thinkin' out loud
I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm a bout to talk a blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women are you here?
Are you here right now? Huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look your getting all your friends, and your getting in your car
And you're coming to the house, are we clear right now, huh
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things, niggas see me rolling and their mood change
Like a muthafucka'
New floors, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you are undercover
I could probably make some steps, let' just fuck each other
Talking filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it
What, tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it

Ooh, it's the 8th wonder
Wonder how I keep coming with the bank number
Downplay the money
I play it off cause you ain't had a lot
She gon' say I'm cocky, told her you know I get that a lot
Coke game, like a night game
At the rave, cocaine, came with the scale mane
Tryna be the only one, that's a lone race
I call you Billy Jean, but what would Mike say
In LA, in LA, we at the mansion, all day
In MIA, all the girls with it
Yeah, late night they say don't stop, get it, get it
8 mil' for the new home
See the gold car, she like why home
No shades, I bring it to your face nigga
Yeah, like what you say, what you say nigga


Oh man, oh man, oh man, not again

Yeah, I learned the game from William Wesley
You can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Whoa, very important and very pretentious
When I look back I might be mad that I gave his attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left a boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all to think that I don't write enough
They just mad cause I got the midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give her a world tour
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to twitter fingers
Yeah, You gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout-out all my boss bitches wife-in niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one
I got the drink in me goin' back to back
Yeah, goin' back to back
I got the drink in me goin' back to back
Yeah, I'm goin' back to back
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell 'em that they better as friends
Not even when you sayin', "Drizzy, tell 'em again"
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryna make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you'd do for fame or what you'd do for freedom
Please, check 'em for a wire or earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' ballsy and goin' wild, see
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga
(Six)


I'm black and Jewish
Don't be so foolish
I'm black and Jewish
It's a Mitzvah

Please don't forget I'm black, please don't forget I'm Jewish
I play ball like Lebron and I know what a W-2 is
Chilling in Boca Raton with my mensch, Lenny Kravitz
The only purple drink we sip is purple Manischewitz
At my show, you won't simply put your hands in the air
We can also raise a chair or recite a Jewish prayer

Like Baruch Yitadel Yisrael
Ve'et ha Kim Kardashian Kanye West, amen
I eat Hova with nova, knishes with my bitches
A bagel and cream cheesy with my boy, his name is Weezy
Do not go to Feingold's, though
The pickles are rubber
And I will not be harming ya
I read the Old Testament, okra and matzahball, I'll eat the rest of it
I celebrate Hanukkah, dated Rihannakah
Birth right in Israel, mama from Canada
Daddy from Africa
Best of worlds when you're Jewish with black in ya
Challah!

Just like that one time at 'chella
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones

Stay in big six six with woes

Still can't see them after snows
I don't have time for the wasteman jokes
Personal ting if I'm getting up close
Loyal to O 'cause I've taken a oath
Versace hotel and I'm taking the robes
Seen 'em in person, I'm seeing a ghost
They told me relax 'cause they're taking control
Take all that shit up with P and his bro
I wish you the best, let me know how it goes
Wanna be free and I wanna let go
We came around and you showed us the most
I know so much shit that I cannot expose
I keep it inside and I laugh on my own
Got all the tea and I'm hottin' it up
I need a shade mansion, a room's not enough
You're droppin' some shit but that shit was a bust
They got no direction, they're followin' us
I come from a city that they never touch
Your man is a goofy and he could get brushed
I can't name a rapper or girl that I trust
I dream about turning these yutes into dust

Back to the basics, I won't lose

They too worried about sellin' out shoes
I don't give a fuck about jeans or crep
Or going to Milan or going to the Met
I just wanna make these songs for the set
I just wanna load that, let that wet
I got so much tings in the stash
Fold up anyone, done that clash
Got no sense like jizzle and shh
Big and bad like leader and shh
Can't do love 'cause they get too attached
Phone get broke and whip get scratched
I'ma just take my knots and cash
They can never tie me down, that's facts
All that bark but we know he's a cat

I'm so fucking dumb I wrote "diamonds" on my thumbs,
It's a diamond on my dick so that's a diamond on her tongue,
I can't feel you baby 'cause I'm romantically numb,
Emotionally drained I came here just so I can come,
There's nothing on the God's sun that I haven't done,
I got a lot of problems gettin pussy just isn't one,
Girls are like buses every 15 mins they run,
Now they like potato chips I just cannot have one,
And I might like you for a minute,
But I don't like your friends in my business,
And I feel like you don't deserve a visit,
Cause you ain't in the kitchen when you want a whipping,

Uh uhhhhhhh,
I know you say you love me girl,
I know you say you love me girl,
Problem is you prolly tell that shit to everybody,
So we hear you talking boo but we just don't believe you,

Uh, ok I'm all about it, all for it,
I'm all-star team Jordan, small forward,
I'm never putting up a shot unless it calls for it,
No hesitation so I'm shooting if I draw for it,
How, How? Fuck is up, now man I'm in this hoe,
Life is moving fast, where the fuck do all these minutes go,
Mixtape dropped then I started getting 10 a show,
Now I get a hundred what the fuck you think I'm in it for,
Young money forever, I bet Gudda, Jae and Mack agree,
Fuck you to the haters that just spend their time attacking me,
Shout out to your girlfriend nigga lately she distracting me,
Wondering if I'm the best, Will I. Am, no Black Eyed Peas,
Girls wanna fuck ya niggas, guy don't wanna be you,
Lining up around the block so that they can get to see you,
I feel like I'll find a wife exactly when I need to,
You can say whatever girl but we just don't believe you,

Uh uhhhhhhh,
I know you say you love me girl,
I know you say you love me girl,
Problem is you prolly tell that shit to everybody,
So we hear you talking boo but we just don't believe you

Feeling for a fix then you should really get yo pheen on 
Yea just know my condo is the crack spot 
Every single show she out there repping like a mascot 
Get it from the back 
And make yo fucking bra strap pop 
All up in yo slot until the nigga hit the jackpots 


I say you the fucking best. 
You the fucking best. 
You the fucking best. 
You the fucking best. 
Best I ever had. 
Best I ever had. 
Best I ever had. 
Best I ever had. 
Best I ever had.


I gotta be honest, I think you know
We're covered in lies, and that's okay
There's somewhere beyond this, I know
But I hope I can find the words to say 

Yeah, normally, it ain't a question
We would cross paths like an intersection
But she just too far away for affection
So I pray that we never lose the connection
'Cause I remember Stacy, she probably hate me
She used to threaten she had a man to replace me
She talked that shit, I just hit the escape key
And then she'd get mad and want to go and erase me
And I remember Amy, she used to AIM me
She stayed up late, and used to blame me
She say I'm too wild, she wanna tame me
I told her 'Even Photoshop couldn't change me'
But you-you-you You got me open, girl, why lie?
We ain't even tryin' to settle, so why try?
End the night with a kiss and a bye-bye
No strings attached, your love is so WiFi

I gotta be honest, I think you know
We're covered in lies, and that's okay
There's somewhere beyond this, I know
But I hope I can find the words to say

My freak girl tell me now she a christian
My white girl wanna move back to Michigan
I'm pullin girls off the bench like a "sixth-man"
I'm in the club doin the same ol' two step
While Omegas doin the same ol' que step
I had my money on my mind I was thinkin green
She a pledge, AKA she was pink and green
I wanna good girl, she want a gentleman
We sayin' the same thing like a synonym
I wasn't really spittin game I was scrimmigin
My pimpinship so hard it needs censorship
I'ma chicagoan till Chicago ends
Till we blow like Chicago wind
I don't know what's better, gettin laid or gettin paid
I just know I'ma gettin one, the other's gettin away

I gotta be honest, I think you know
We're covered in lies, and that's okay
There's somewhere beyond this, I know
But I hope I can find the words to say


This here is on some truthful shit
It seems like everything I do, your used to it
And I hate hearing stories bout who you've been with

Swear I gotta hide, what I'm feelin inside
So you still think I'm confident and dumb

Is this gonna last? Your up on a pedestal
Are we moving too fast?
Feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past
This why I gotta ask, is 

Anything I'm doin brand new?

Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doin brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Brand new girl

This here is on some remix shit
It seems like everything I do they're leakin it
And I hate hearin stories of who I'm sleepin wit

Thats when I gotta hide who I got in the ride
So she still thinks I'm confident and down

How long will this last
My life is on a pedestal am I movin to fast
It feels like I am in crazy competition wit my past
Thats why I gotta ask. . . .

Is anything I'm doin brand new
Brand new

Im so sorry
Did you hope I was crying?
It was rough without you
It was rough without you

I did some charity today for the kids
But I'm used to it cause all y'all charity cases
All yall stare in my face in hopes you could be the replacement
Niggas snitching on us without no interrogation
I stay silent cause we at war and Im very patient
Six God is watching, I just hope youre prepared to face him
Im charged up, Im charged up

Wow, Im honored that you think this is staged
Im flattered man, in fact, Im amazed
The perfect start to the summer, man this shit is a doozy
This shit the twist in the movie but don't jump to conclusions
You boys are getting into your feelings on me
You should embrace it, this could be one of our realest moments
Okay the flow start to feel familiar, dont it?
Must I remind you that Jimmy got 20 million on it
Need DJ Clue to drop a bomb on it
None of them want this shit more than I want it
I seen it all coming, knew they were pushing buttons
Easter egg hunting, they gotta look for something
Done doing favors for people
Cause it aint like I need the money I make off a feature
I see you niggas having trouble going gold
Turning into some so and sos that no one knows
But so it go
Come and live all your dreams out at OVO
We gonna make sure you get your bread and you know the ropes
I get a ring and I bring it home like Im Corey Joe
No woman ever had me star struck
Or was able to tell me to get my bars up
Im charged up
Oh no we eating, niggas aint about to starve us
Nah, niggas ain't about to starve us
I'm charged up

I bought my niggas rollies off of Thank Me Later
While these boys was stanky legging
Trust me this information is vital
Im trying to take the high road
I still got love for my idols
I got me a deal with Apple and I still feel entitled
Rumor has it, theres something that only I know
Rumor has it, I steer this shit with my eyes closed
Rumor has it, I either fucked her or I never could
But rumor has it, hasnt done you niggas any good
Its sound, sound, sound til the day I die
We going live to keep this shit alive
Cops are killing people with their arms up
And your main focus is tryna harm us?
And you think you bout to starve us?
Niggas aint about to starve us
Nah, Im charged up

Have you seen me?
Im doing so good
Everytime I leave
Oh, Im so sorry


I've always wondered why you bothered putting make up on
You don't need it
Even tho I always tell you that your beautiful
I repeat cause I don't want no singer and I don't want no model I don't want no fashion designer or nothing
I just want your love
Telling you that's more than enough 4 me

All you gotta do is
Come real
Shawty what's the deal don't think just cause your simple that you lose your appeal
I wouldn't have it any other way hey ay ay ayy

All you gotta do is
Come real
Shawty what's the deal don't think just cause your simple that you lose your appeal
I wouldn't have it any other way hey ay ay ayy

Baby just because I wanna look good don't think I ain't real
Not in the least bit
All the clothes and the doing of my hair face nails makes me feel good
Nd I'll keep it up on the 10
What you been saying to me ain't exactly what I need to feel and know
Your the one I'm wearing for and where I will always go when I need a reason to

Stay real
What you make me feel
It's true beauty is the ultimate appeal
And I don't want it any other way hey ay ay ayy

To stay real
What you make me feel
It's true beauty is the ultimate appeal
And I don't want it any other way hey ay ayy


Uh....yea, alright. well alright. well alright. uhuh. yeah. .....feels good.

It's a celebration, clap clap bravo,
lobster and shrimp and a glass of moscado for the girl who's a student, and her friend who's a model.
Finish the whole bottle, and we gon do it big like this...yea, and he was just practice.
He aint in your world, you can take him off your atlas.
Girl, you on fire, can I be the one you match with?
I'll give you the credit card, and baby you can max this, ah-out.
Show me where your tats is.
Show me where your heads at; maybe I can grasp it.
They say if you get her, you can understand her better,
and she's known to be a cheater, but that's only if you let her.
And I got it together.
So when they talk and try to deter me, it's like whatever.
Tell em I appreciate the help, but I just gotta know for myself.

ayo, ayo, ayo....

This lifestyle is foul, this shit'll damage ya.
Especially when you think no one's understandin ya.
These girl groups with their overprotective managers got paparrazi over my shoulder,
clickin they cameras.
Snap, snap, snap, until they runnin outta card space.
You remind me of Tony's sister in Scarface.
Just take it easy on love, and slow your heart rate.
Goodness gracious, the top is such a hard place. Yeah.
But if you never even been there, it kinda makes sense why you dyin to pretend, dear.
Spillin all your drinks, and takin pictures in your swimwear.
Head up in the clouds, you survivn on the thin air.
I know that shit is exhaustin, girl...and your mistakes are costin, girl...
and maybe you don't need the help, but I just gotta see for myself.


I'm in shock
The nerve, the audacity
Okay

So if you rebuke me for working with someone else on a couple of Vs
What do you really think of the nigga that's making your beats?
I've done things for him I thought that he never would need
Father had to stretch his hands out and get it from me
I pop style for 30 hours, then let him repeat
Now, you popping up with the jokes, I'm dead, I'm asleep
I just left from over by y'all putting pen to the sheets
Tired of sitting quiet, and helping my enemies eat
Keep getting temperature checks
They know that my head overheats
Don't know why the fuck you niggas listen to Denim or Steve
Must've had your Infrared wrong, now your head in the beam
Y'all are the spitting image of whatever jealousy breeds
Don't push me when I'm in album mode
You not even top 5 as far as your label talent goes
You send shots, well, I got to challenge those
But I bring Calicos to the Alamo
I could never have a Virgil in my circle and hold him back 'cause he makes me nervous
I wanna see my brothers flourish to their higher purpose
You niggas leeches and serpents
I think it's good that now the teachers are learning, yeah
Your brother said, it was your cousin then him, then you
So, you don't rap what you did, you just rap what you knew
Don't be ashamed, it's plenty niggas that do what you do
There's no malice in your heart, you're an approachable dude
Man, you might've sold to college kids for Nike Mercedes
But you act like you sold drugs for Escobar in the '80s
I had a microphone of yours, but then the signature faded
I think that pretty much resembles what's been happening lately
Please believe your demise will be televised, yeah
And as for Q, man, I changed his life a couple times
Nigga was at Kroger working double time
Ya'll acting like he made the boy when I was trying to help the guy
Yeah, who gassed you to play with me?
Man, you made this shit as easy as ABCs
Whoever supposedly making me hits, but then got no hits sound like they need me
My hooks did it, my lyrics did it, my spirit did it
I'm fearless with it, yeah
I really shouldn't have given you none of my time
'Cause you older than the nigga you running behind
Look, holla at me when you multi-million
I told you keep playing with my name and I'ma let it ring on you
Like Virginia Williams
I'm too resilient, get out your feelings
It's gonna be a cruel summer for you
I told Weezy and Baby "I'ma done him for you"
Tell 'Ye we got a invoice coming to you
Considering that we just sold another 20 for you

To be honest
Duppy


Cause I, ooooh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah

I can tell you something
But you tell me do you wanna talk about, talk about
You say you got a lot on your mind, sit down lets talk about it (talk about)
I hate to see you feel this way
So tell me what can I do to make it better for you
Make it better for you babe, hey...

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah
(wassup)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah

Really tell me what I gotta do to get you to talk about (talk about)
Cause its been getting a little too long for you not to talk about
So tell me what you would like me to do, to help you, help me, help you
Cause I dont really want to tell you without you

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah
Tell me why

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah

(wassup)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah

Bothers me when you got to play therapist

They even bring up these niggas make the comparison
They just got to forgive me, this watch is a 150
Still aint got the time for a bitch to be acting iffy
Running through the city with niggas Id give a kidney
Selling under 150 you niggas gotta be kidding
Is this even still a discussion?
Dont you ever wake up disgusted?
Every million I gain an enemy or a cousin
And peoples feelings have changed ever since I became somethin
Girls that becoming ladies
And my friends are having babies
And babies are dropping dead in my city
This shit is crazy
And I dont know if speaking on it helps
This the shit thats on my mind I just keep it to myself
You know

Cant you talk to me
Lets talk about it, talk about it

I want to get straight to the climax (straight straight to the)
Have you coming all summer like a season pass

Want to watch you do work while I sit back

Can Ican I save you from you
'Cause you know there's something missing?
And that champagne you've been sipping
Not suppose to make you different
All the time

It's starting to feel like the wrong thing to do, girl 'Cause with all that recognition
It gets hard for you to listen
To the things that I'mma say to make you mine

But live, girl, have some fun, girl, we'll be fine
Trying to convince myself I found one
Making the mistake I never learned from!

I swear, I always fall for your type. Yeah
For your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type 
For your type

I just can't explain this shit at all!
Fall for your type
I just can't explain this shit at all!
Fall for your type
I believe in people like you!

So who am I to judge you on the past, girl?
I bet there's a reason for it all
You say that you're nothing like the last girl
I just pray that you don't let me down right now
It's too late. I'm already yours
You just gotta promise me hearts won't break
And end up like before

I swear, I always fall for your type. Yeah
For your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type
For your type

Look
Dress hangin' off your shoulder, barely sober
Telling me how you're moving away and starting over
Girl, quit playin', you just drunk, you just saying shit
And you dance, dance like how like ballet and shit

Oh, wait. No, I get it, girl. I'm with it
I been down this road before and yeah I skidded
But forget it
Damn, damn

I wonder why I never learn my lesson
It's feeling like a second chance and it's the first impression
And I heard there's nothing new except for someone new
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you?

Talking to myself but I never listen
'Cause, man, it's been a while and I swear that this one's different
That's why I'mma take you anywhere you wanna go
Let you meet my friends
So they can lecture me again
About how reckless I have been

And I'm slowly running out of all the time that I invested
Making all the same mistakes
And I'm just trying to correct it
And I fall

I swear, I always fall for your type. Yeah
For your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type 
For your type

I just can't explain this shit at all!
Fall for your type
I just can't explain this shit at all!
Fall for your type
I believe in people like you!


Take you back,
Take you back,
That was such a lie.
Every time you said you loved me, you can't look me in my eyes,
And I beg you for the truth, so much goin' thru my mind,
And my father did just pass, to make my problems multiply,
And I know nobody's perfect, but you finally crossed the line,
And I gave you everything, but you was never satisfied,
And you said I was the one, just like you told another five,
Feel like it's a competition against all these other guys.

Texted me the other night, it's been too long,
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on.
Staring at the ceiling almost all night long,
Probably why I had the time to write this song.
Texted me the other night, it's been too long,
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on.
Staring at the ceiling almost all night long,
Probably why I had the time to write this song.

Every time I see you, feels like time is moving slow,
It's unfortunate for me, I have some trouble letting go,
Even though it's in the past, I just felt like you should know.
And you hate me when I get high, but you're the reason that I smoke.
Girl quit playin',
Girl quit playin',
You ain't love me from the start,
You're the reason that I feel this way, 
You broke my fuckin' heart,
And I gave you all my trust, but you just tore it all apart,
Now you're all I think about while I'm layin' in the dark.

Texted me the other night, it's been too long,
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on.

Probably why I had the time to write this song.

Been a couple months and you're beggin' for me back,
And I love all the attention, I'm not sure how I should act,
And you're saying that you miss me, I refuse to say it back,
Even though I still do want you, I don't have the time for that,
'Cause these women stay the same, while this nigga's chasin' cash,
And your problems are so small, girl just trust me they ain't bad,
'Cause you cryin' bout a nigga while I'm cryin' bout my dad,
And its eating me alive, should've taken me instead.

Texted me the other night, it's been too long,
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on.

Yeah

I've been waitin', let's get 'em bro

Nah, for real
Shout out Boi-1da too
Mm, I like that

Let's get 'em Driz

You don't have a drink, you're not drinking or what?

I got a drink bro

Hahahaha, I like that

I got my drink right here. Cheers my bro

Toast up man
Yeah, okay, yeah

Goldman Sachs, they wanna hold my racks
Hedge fund investors talk to Adel like he the expert
I hear it in they tone when they address him
We way too connected
Tom Ford assistant texted asking if I want classic or double breasted
I flex with broad shoulders
When I walk through the halls they move over
Stories about how we handle ours start to travel like a lone soldier
I told you
You hold your girl the same way that I hold composure
Or hold the wheel of the Fuji white Rover
Silverstein dinners, all kosher
Never rushin'
My niggas really made somethin' from nothin'
Dodge sentences like they don't wanna discuss it, change subject
Got the Benny Yang chains rubbin', never tucked in
Waiting to inhale
Things that I own will sell at auction as proof we did well
My house museum-scale
The only skeletons here are the ones from the nights I raised hell
Make sure the staff are paid well
Make 'em think twice 'bout the stories that they tell
No one knows when the plan is hatchin'
I'ma let 'em walk on eggshells
Tiptoe, niggas better know

Wow, man like Drizzy Drake!

Yeah

Got his foot on your neck man

What time is it? What time is it? It's like two in the morning right now.

Yeah, well it's real late over here

It's me and Charlie, that's it, you hear me? We got the whole building to ourselves.

We got the building. Kill them again, kill them again Driz, kill them!

Y'all keepin' the score while watchin' me score
Y'all keep the awards, I'll take the rewards
If y'all goin' for fun, I'll stay and record
But if y'all goin' to war I'm there for sure
Wouldn't miss it
I'm living next to Michael, Bobby, Ralph, Johnny
My neighbors soundin' like New Edition
That's these guys
Us guys don't wear New Balance or Levi's
Key West retirement plan
Grippin' the Callaway club in my hand
Hittin' balls off of the balcony into the sand
Tryna see where they land
October Firm the new chain of command
El chico, this verse is the explanation for the large ego
100 mill' hands free like Ronaldinho
I go from Star to Venetian in a small speedboat with girls we know
Take your pick, Brooke or Tanya
Both those shorties'd leave their GPS on so I can find ya
Drop location
Spring break trips, I'm in hot rotation
I took a lot of my brothers from B and E licks or the pot rotation
To ridin' shotgun in a Picasso painting
Tricks up sleeves, have 'em playin' innocent to get the shits I need
Loyalty is priceless to me and this I see
Before I ever seen this shit tatted on P and tatted on C and tatted on me
I speak truth and get to shatterin' dreams
So it's best to tiptoe, niggas better know, yeah

Drizzy Drake! You're an animal Drake! You already know that you an animal bruh! Animal!

I'm saucy!

Saucy! You just stepped out of the club straight into the booth like it's light. Tear up the ting in one take!

Showed up for you, you know what I'm sayin'?

My brother Drizzy

My brother, you already know

Wow. And you know what it's like. You stepped out the club into the booth to prove to everyone why you number one bro. Why you got your foot on their necks!

Nah for real. I stepped in here, SN1, OVO, Fire in the Booth, Charlie Sloth. Come on. The official. I rock with the official. I'm on official ting, you know what it is man. Come on, come on

Ayy bro, it feels like that's another moment there, you know what? Like, I got to say this to you on the real bro. The way that you've embraced British culture will be remembered forever. And the UK love you. The real G's over here, you know that bro. When you go to your parties, you see who's in your parties.

Nah, you know what it is, of course

It's the certies

Nah, listen, but listen. It's a family and it's a big family, you know what it is. I'm just happy to be home, like I said man.

My brother, man. Foot on neck time.

Yo, are these guys dumb? You see the big man Charlie too, oh my goodness.

My brother Drizzy. I can hear these rappers' prayers man.

Nah, I'm heated for you right now

They're like, "Yo, please tell Drizzy to take his foot off my neck!"

Nah, I'm heated right now man, oh my goodness. Shout out French Montana, my brother, you know what I'm sayin'? The big wave, yeah. Shout out Huncho, Quavo. Shout out Offset, blessings on the new ting. Oh my goodness. Shout out, yo. I could go for hours. Charlie, come on man.

Ayy, you could go for hours. I was at your party the other night, I've seen who was there. I'm like, "Woah!" There's a lot of people, there was a lot of faces in that party.

Nah, I don't wanna hear no chat for the whole 18 about Charlie Sloth. Are you dumb? Alright. Jheeze, jheeze.

And that right there: one take. A real moment right there.

Yeah, jhee!

And that's Fire in the Booth my guy!

And I'll be back January-February part two, you know what time it is. Come on!

Okay, okay

Shout out all the G's too, man. Shout out all the artists man. Everybody from here doin' their thing. I'm telling you. Big inspiration. London, England, come on man.

Come on! You know I've applied for your passport, right?

Hahaha. I need that


Yeah, yeah
Y'all must be listening to Mies 'cause y'all doing less
Never more, shoulda guessed, rapping on beats like they pilots
Made a couple milli then I bought myself a cool house
With a pool house designed by Rem Koolhaas
I'm talking OMA, you're like OMG
I'm SOM, you're SOL, you SOB
Some call me Biggie, some call me Bjarke
Either way, I'm notorious: B.I.G
I heard your new tape and I laughed, like
Zaha ha ha ha ha ha ha Hadid
My bars are art so they're on those walls
My bars hard like Ando's walls (that's real)
Your minimal mind is kinda blank, scary
Your momma's face designed by Frank Gehry (oh god)
I need a final bar that oughta do it, I know
You couldn't bring down the house if it was called Pruitt Igoe


I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure

How you feel about coming home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fucking out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?

Tongue kisses, stank hoes at the Coachella
Thank the Lord she never listen what a hoe tell her
Not only could I do better, but I know better
How could I ever be the king without a Coretta?
Feeling like Rae, same damn Lo sweater
MAC 10, Beretta for the cold weather
Her ex let her blow cheddar, she a go getter
Hoe, clothes fit her, more wetter, but her flow better
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Keep machine gun strapped in case a nigga wanna act up
Petite gun raps ain't even strong enough to match us
Machine gun BLAT in case a nigga wanna act tough
Ain't nothing like a bad bitch
That make a jiggy nigga wanna go and run up in that shit raw
Like Brother Man from the 5th floor
I creep up in it, deep up in it 'til she tell a nigga, It's yours
I know this shit is mine for the taking
If I ain't a Mason it's some gay shit
Prolly why I don't react when you say this shit
Half the times niggas don't even make sense
Know this shit is yours
When you do a world tour all off a mixtape shit
You know this shit is yours
When your face on every magazine cover, every page shit
You know this shit is yours
When you fuck a new different bad broad every day shit
Only get high just to compliment my maintenance
I took a little moment out to say this


You've been home for three whole days
Actin' like you got chores to do
Boy this house is way too clean
I don't think there's nothing more to do
Oh, you don't need that girl, she did it all wrong
You was still you before she ever came along
Get over it, get over it
I mean I understand the pain
Someone did me the same
I just put that nigga in his place then I got over it
Then I got over it and if you wanna know the truth

I think you should just get dressed and go out tonight
Go out tonight
Order you a drink, don't even overthink
Call a couple friends you know you can have some fun with
And go out tonight, go out tonight
Cause you might just meet me

And I'm lookin' for, and I'm lookin' for
And I'm lookin' for somebody to be with
And I'm lookin' for what you're lookin' for
Yeah, you might just meet me

Half of us is grown men, the other half is children

Show her how to dress right...tighten up her lacefront
Show her not to wear a tan dress with no beige pumps
Uh

Fresh Dior slippers n a crispy white cami
Wow

Eyebrows lookin like Burt Reynold's moustache

I love you


You don't know what's in store
But you know what you're here for
Close your eyes, lay yourself beside me
Hold tight for this ride
We don't need no protection
Come alone, we don't need attention

This verse starts as my snipers hit their marks
And your guards fall down from a rifle to the heart
Like clap clap, let em fall slow
I know you had your fears you can let them all go
And most women are motivated, so I act accordingly
But this is so refreshing that it means a little more to me
Dedicating time when I really cant afford to be
I provide protection if you open up the door for me
Couple stares, couple texts, couple dates
Couple I think that were readys
Couple I think we should waits
Are we acting like a couple, Im just trying to get it straight
Cause Im over here convinced that its too early for mistakes

You had to change up the game
Oh the weather is not the same
Now theres only cloudy days
I cant stand the rain in July, (oh July)
There were fireworks exploding (exploding)
But now its getting colder
The leaves are turning colors
Why, its just not our season
The one and only reason
Baby oh baby oh
Our summer turned into fall

Damn, tell me where did all the magic go
I followed all the rules and told you everything you had to know
Had you over every night, every night was passionate
Plus you met my mother even if it was an accident
Im confused, tell me where we go wrong
I was sure that I would be with you so long
I was planning on this being something worth mentioning
Energy invested in someone I saw potential in
Who killed Chivalry they need to get their sentencing
Meanwhile we arguing and I cant get a sentence in
And just as I predicted here we go again
They always say the hottest love has the coldest end

Take it off, I want it all
Cause I know what youre feeling!
Its OK, girl, I feel it too!
Let it be, baby please
I swear, Im, not like him!
Youll be good, promise, youll be so good!

Our summer turned into fall
See its funny cause
I never thought this would end
But then the season changed

You were my, you were my, you were my girl (I was your girl)
Shouldve made, shouldve made, shouldve made you my World
Shouldve made you everything to make you happy baby

Cant wait for, cant wait for
Cant wait for springtime
And I will turn into a butterfly
I will spread my wings and fly
And Im too fly for the shit
Oh, I am Japanese if you please


Shorty I got more money than I ever had
But you the only thing I need right now 
You make it all so simple, you my new thing
Ha Ha Ha Ha!

I fuck her like an addict, she fuck me like she mad at me
But it's all cool though, I flew out Aneisha just last week
When I'm away she send me pics in the sheets
Saw my grin on my cars on my sneaks
Wait, let me keep this shit simple
Fuck the radio this shit's a nigga tempo
Fat boy blue jeans and a gold watch
Started at the bottom then she rolled on top
Black testerosa, zero to sixty on the strip she's explosive
Just got back from Dubai, Emirates live flew in with 1.5
Never fold is the threshold, like my mother sayin now never let go
Hood nigga with a escrow, bad bitch but she special
Went home and I prayed for a angel appeared in the dark here to take away the pain too
War wombs on the big dog, but she get the ball like it's tip off
Watch D-Wade got two seats, got her everything but the blue beach
Cartier wings nigga two seats, nigga gettin money like a new Meech
We the knights of the Templar, dirty little nigga with ten cars
This whole clique another Enron, baby girl it's time for you to get gone
Here's a shoulder just to lean on, Rozay baby and the team strong

I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly

Cause you're a good girl and you know it...
You act so different around me...
Cause you're a good girl and you know it...
I know exactly who you could be...
Just hold on, we're going home...
Just hold on, we're going home...
It's hard to do these things alone...
Just hold on, we're go-ing home, ohh-ohh oh ohhhh..

I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see

Real ting ay

I pull up on you in that purple thing bumpin' Purple Rain
Singin' "Purple Rain, " sippin' purple rain
Pourin' champagne off commercial fame
You ain't worth a thing, you ain't gang gang
You ain't flame gang, you ain't same gang
It's my world, it's Wayne's world
It's a different world, it's Dewayne Wayne, oh Lord
Okay now we got some action
Fuck models out of Maxim
I'm too wavy, I'm a captain
Okay now we got some rapids
Orange bottle full of tablets
Okay now we got some habits
Smokin' cookies, sippin' lean
Okay now we got some balance
You see my team is right next to me
You don't see Tina right next to me
I thank her for takin' my breath from me
But the second me gon' be the better me
J.R. Smith with the shot
Cause I pull up, I stop and pop
I call my AK Barney
And I'm a let this baby pop
Pull up on you like Steph Curry
With my foot up on you like F worries
Been outchea since Keith Murray
Codeine got me with pink urine
So you know I don't have the energy
I fucked a bitch named Epiphany
My exes wanna be friends with my other exes
And I don't have the sympathy

Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

Yeah, I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need addressin'
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my lil homie
'09 they was biddin' on me
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me
Ok now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But off verses, he been blackin'
Chasin' women a distraction
They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right

Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

I don't take this shit for granted
I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
6 cold like Alaska
Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta go, they gotta go
They gonna die out eventually
I cannot give 'em no empathy
I'm a have B's when I'm 70
They cannot fuck with the legacy
I don't know what else is left for me
After this no one a threat to me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done


Boy Wonder (Boi1Da),
(C.O.S.S.O.M)
Drizzy,

I get money,
I get paper,
I get girls all different flavors,
I buy gucci, I buy prada,
I spend dolla after dolla 

Y'all don't really like me,
I can understand,
My flow is sitting right inside the pocket of my pants,
I still fly, you can't float,
Run this shit, Usain Bolt,
I write your favorite records all you sing ghost,
20 thousand for a verse is our routine quote,
I'm getting rich while you stayin broke,
Chillin even if I'm in a goose down coat,
I cant see you through a Mosley Tribes
So i don't even flinch when you throw me high fives,
They try to measure up but there is no one my size,
Whatever 40 smoking about to lower my eyes,
Beast mode on em, I never take a night off,
Every single thing a nigga purchase is a write off,
Grounded as the runway pavement I take the flight off,
Baby go ahead and cut the light off,

I'm the rookie of the year (year)
About to get my dough on,
I'm about to take off, baby you should hold on,
But I ain't about to prolong,
Imma keep it short and tell you whats about to go on,
Bottle after bottle cos the money like so long,
Baby.. we about to put a show on,
Imma show off, like I'm supposed to,
Yeah you can get lost, i don't know you,

I hear my phone ringing when you call,
I ain't picking up an' entertaining them at all,
Got your girl face down banging on the wall,
While you and all your homeboys hang at Lenox Mall
Hmm, hmm, hmmm,
I cannot relate,
Riding with some tags that i got from outta state,
Riding with a swag that I got from outta space,
Just show me who's the hottest Imma knock em outta place,
Call me homicide drizzy about to kill your ego,
I'm about my green puffing guddi like I'm Cee-Lo
You can go and take a glance at your hero,
While a Houston stripper pole dance in a Z-ro
Fantasy to you, reality to me,
And my g-pass is as valid as can be,
I'm, I'm so fresh the stylist would agree,
Waving at your girl while she smiling back at me

 

Louie too,
Yeah, Alexander McQueen,
I'm so clean
Its KC and Drizzy,
And its the remix remix,
C.O.S.S.O.M
Hehe


Ayy, yeah
Pipe this shit up and I turn this shit up
When I was down, I was down
Now them diamonds for fun like damn
Ayy, yeah

Trendsetter, Ben Frank getter (Yeah)
Whip whatever, whip whatever
I buy diamonds when I'm under pressure (Yeah)
When I apply it, shit don't ever let up, yeah
Look, I'm in the cut, the boy in the cut
Jump in the whip where the ceilings go up, we up
All of this grindin' for what?
It's funny when you niggas thought it was luck
I cannot give you a pass if you play with my money and family and friends
And I compete with myself while you niggas competin' with trends
Your foreign is used, I looked up the VIN
I know the truth, no use in pretendin' with him

Still in the cut, the boy in the cut
Hop in the whip where the ceilings go up, we up

And I'm way up at the top of the loft
Gotta stay up, ain't no knockin' me off
Pull up smooth, A.I. with the cross
Countin' up wins on wins on wins, for all of my dawgs I lost
I might call Pharrell, get the new Chanel
Thugger got the YSL, huh
I remember when the Feds did the sweep, I pray my dawgs didn't tell, huh
Cruisin' down Biscayne
I was in Miami, she gave me top with the top off
Cartier wrist gang, got her a Audemar
She got a head, knock your socks off
You ain't gettin' money, you ain't fuckin' with me
You ain't in your bitch top five
I might pull up in the Six with Drizzy
I was just in Houston, fuckin' with the mob ties
We don't never ever play two sides
Hang out the Phantom, it's suicide
They ridin' my wave like a road tie
My necklace is wet like the poolside

Still in the cut, the boy in the cut, yeah

Hop in the whip where the ceilings go up, we up


Emotions in this game run deep,
So before they say this to me in my sleep,
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure,
Repping to my last second dude,
Done a lot of shit they never get to do,
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure,
Honored to be somebody they mention,
But before these niggas stop paying attention...
I just say it's been a pleasure,
You'll never be somebody they need
Tomorrow ain't guaranteed so tonight we gon do it like this,

Like ohhhh...
For the A-Town, tonight I'm going to let somebody go
For the A-Town

Uhh, set up the occasion,
I'm up in the place in,
If amazing was a young bitch,
I be going to jail cuz I be fucking amazing,
What's up for the taking,
I'm ready and I'm willing, why the fuck are we waiting,
Yeah, and baby you should bring your best friend,
Then you should persuade her to let me get some sex in,
Don't get offended baby that's just a suggestion,
Really we can do it like however,you,like,
I'm probably in your hotel tonight,
Whatever floor that me and 40 staying on is smelling riiight,
Yeah, just know we grinding til it's light out,
Show up in your city turn that muthafucker right out,
Yeah, tell me who controls kings,
I don't follow rules, stupid old things,
I'm riding through the city in the coupe with those wings,
My team deserves some muthafucking superbowl rings,
Oh yeah, and I know we gon get it,
Me and Jeezy bout whatever shorty holla if you wit it,
Even though I want it to this shit don't last forever,
But better late than never, honestly I'd like to say it's been a pleasure,

Like ohhhh...
For the A-Town, tonight I'm going to let somebody go
For the A-Town


Uhh, this verse starts as my snipers hit their marks
And your guards fall down from a rifle to the heart
Like clap clap, let em fall slow
I know you had your fears you can let them all go
And most women are motivated so I act accordingly
But this is so refreshing that it means a little more to me
Dedicating time when I really cant afford to be
I provide protection if you open up the door for me
Couple stares, couple texts, couple dates
Couple "I think that were readys"
Couple "I think we should waits"
Are we acting like a couple, Im just trying to get it straight
'Cause Im over here convinced that its too early for mistakes

You had to change up the game
Oh the weather is not the same
Now theres only cloudy days
I can't stand the rain in July
Oh July
There were fireworks exploding (exploding)
But now its getting colder
The leaves are turning colors
Why, its just not our season
The one and only reason
Baby oh baby oh
Our summer turned into fall

Damn, tell me where did all the magic go
I followed all the rules and told you everything you had to know
Had you over every night, every night was passionate
Plus you met my mother even if it was an accident
Im confused tell me where we go wrong
I was sure that I would be with you so long
I was planning on this being something worth mentioning
Energy invested in someone I saw potential in
Who killed Chivalry they need to get their sentencing
Meanwhile we arguing and I cant get a sentence in
And just as I predicted here we go again
They always say the hottest love has the coldest end

See its funny 'cause I never thought this would end but then the season changed

You were my, you were my, you were my girl (I was your girl)
Should've made, should've made, should've made you my World
Should've made you everything to make you happy baby

Cant wait for, cant wait for, cant wait for springtime
And I will turn into a butterfly
I will spread my wings and fly
And Im too fly for the shit
Oh, I am Japanese if you please


Lets go,
Well alright, well alright,
Look,

Uh, feeling sorry for the runner up,
Im still awake getting money while the sun is up,
and they keep saying how they need me to deliver
cos they hate it when the rookie star doesnt put the numbers up,
Man, hate is so passe, catch me anytime for a suit on draft day,
nigga and its just me and my money,
ya dont even get to play when yall leading by 20,
yeah I infiltrated the game,
i was hesitant at first and fear what it would change,
now Im high off the success and faded off of the fame,
and still managed to keep all of my opinions the same,
I am so far gone bitch I'm outta here,
hotter than standing inside rocking outerwear,
I want it all man, I never learned how to share,
I also can no longer converse with you thousandaires,
wow, I swear I'm killing shit I'm killing shit,
shout out to my niggas I just made a couple million with,
yeah from the beginning to the end,
know Im into making history not into making friends,
muthafucker.


Woah, woah
Yeah

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy
Shawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy
I've seen some niggas attack and don't end up makin' it back

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

I'm in the trenches, relax
Can you not play that lil' boy in the club? 'Cause we do not listen to rats
We in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me Tae is the best
Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the 'net
I'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon' get stretched
Ooh-oh
Bring Drake to the hood, surround Drake around Dracs
Even though I got a case, I'ma do what it take

And I never been embraced
And the money's hard to make
So I bet they on they face right now

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

When he tell the story, that's not how it went
Know they be lyin', a hundred percent
Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'
Valet just called me to tell me come get it
Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah
Heart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'
Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea
And then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it
It's hard to believe it

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?


Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck it y'all thinkin'?
Makin' sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin'
'Bout to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett

I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home?
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known

Got the gold thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super-good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker

Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either
Point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it throwin' hundreds
When I should be throwin' ones, bitch, I run it

I know way too many people...
I know way too many people here right now
here here right now, here right now, here here here right now
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone 

Whenever, wherever then if you let me
don't try to begin,
If you considerin' about stoppin' this flow,
you need a friend,

So break me off a piece of that, so sweet,
so bad, the kitty cat,
In the' cuzzi in Rome, remember that? 
I need you soon, I'll be your groom

This Feelin', this vibe, this night in June,
I remember you said your hips don't 
lie, love it when they move

I will only bring good vibes in your life,
your love consumes,
All day, every day I dream of being with
only you, and them hips.

I know way too many people...
I know way too many people here right now
here here right now, here right now, here here here right now
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone 

One thing about music, when it hits you feel no pain
And I swear I got the shit that makes these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game
It's what comes with the fame and I'm ready for that, I'm just sayin'

I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over

So I'm riding through this city with my high-beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your wise friend on
If you thinkin' I'mma quit before I die, dream on

Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kiddin'?
And nobody's ever done it like I did it

I know way too many people...
I know way too many people here right now
here here right now, here right now, here here here right now
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone 

I know way too many people...
I know way too many people here right now
here here right now, here right now, here here here right now
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone 


Ive been up for 4 days
Getting money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold spades
Rolex's, chauffeurs, and low fades
I keep thinking how young can you die from old age
The always tell me no one is working as hard as you
And even though I laugh it off man its probably true
Cuz while all of my closest friends out partying
I'm just here making all the music that they party too
But party on, party on, all night nigga
I got these new rappers nervous prom night nigga
I grow tired of these fucking grown man liars
Story tellers, they aint even need a camp fire
Uhh, but I just wanna tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
This sh-t feel like when fredro star was a sunset park stunting hard in his yellow goose
Ya, and I'ma motherfucking missed target
But a target none the less, and I just started
Was that directed at Moi?
Cant be, they must be talking to themselves Hov, hands free
Yeah, and I'm just filling up this daily planner
Getting busy cuz I'm a star, no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talking in their music
And I just say I wrote it for yo girlfriends Kelsey Grammar
Yah, that's what life becomes when you doing you
Welcome to Hollywood don't let this town ruin you
And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwing you
Just know that she gon tell another nigga when she through with you
Don't get impatient when it takes to long
And drink it all even when it taste too strong yeah
I gotta feel alive, even if it kills me
Promise to always give you me, the real me

Who would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
(Hey, Guru, tell homegirl to go to open that Ace right there),
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up

OWWWWWWW, Hov turning heads like OWLSSSSS

Triple entendre don't even ask me how
Con-Edison Flo I'm connected to a high power
Bright lights will make your whole city light up
A trillion watt light bulb when I'm in the night club
I just landed in that G-450, caught the mayweather fight cuz his satellite was crispy
Uhh, yall can miss me with the money talk
The smart moneys on Hov, f-ck what the dummys talk
I don't do to much blogging, I just run the town, I don't do to much jogging
I aint gotta scar yet, you fucking round with me and my dogs is far fetched
Drake, heres how they gon come at you
With silly rap feuds trying to distract you
In disguise in the form of a favor
The Barzini meeting, watch for the traitors
Uhh, and I've seen it all done it all
That's why none of these dum dums could done him off
The summers ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like windows 7
You let em tell it they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was, cool as the fonz was,
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry mama I'm promised they wouldn't change me,
But I woulda went insane, had I remain the same ME
Fuck niggas, bitches too
All I got is this money, this will do

Who would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
(Hey, Guru, tell hom' to go to open that Ace right there),
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down
I'm gon' make this go

Yeah, they twins, I could tell they ass apart
I got big packs coming on the way
I got big stacks coming out the safe
I got Lil Max with me, he the wave
It's a big gap between us in the game
In the next life, I'm tryna stay paid
When I die, put my money in the grave

When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race

Stay with her sister now, she got a man, but he out of town
Soon as he out of town, they hop in his whip and they ride around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to slidin', slidin'
Thought about trappin' a player before, but that just ain't right, right
Look in the mirror if you wanna look at some things on the bright side
You proud of 325, you feelin' too good to worry to tonight

We both wake up, staring at the sky
Dont remember how we got here but we dont wonder why
Right now we living life like theres no way we can die
But we bout to do our thing they couldnt stop us if they try
Keep the weapon for the haters if they try to blow our high
How the fuck would they stop us if we by each others side
We were meant to be together we get inside
How the hell would they kill us when were feeling so alive

Ooh girl I know you want a G
Its kinda hard not to notice me
Cause I'm right here where you wanna be
I can take you where you wanna go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

Baby I can give what you want and everything you need
Put us both in a position where we can both succeed
And if it takes a sacrifice I promise I will bleed
All the blessings that I get I promise youll receive
fuck them other niggas all they do is deceive
Let me take away your pain, my job is to relieve

Ooh girl I know you want a G
Its kinda hard not to notice me
Cause I'm right here where you wanna be

Look at my history
I'm trying to see what's different from that guy and the richer me
The only thing I see is custom owls from Tiffany
And some gunnas that'll hit you outta nowhere, like epiphany
Really that's it to me
Aside from the obvious, man, it changes in scenery
Testing me gon' have my niggas testing machinery
They say that they happy, my man, that's not how they seem to be
The boy, he wild and peaceful, rest in peace Teena Marie
Ethics and values, mob traditions, old fashioned
Monopoly action
Bronny buying up Brentwood like he still in Akron
A lot of pain, a lot of passion
A lot of relaxing while other niggas is overreacting
That's how we continue down the path of Jordan and Jackson
That's some insight for y'all even if no one's asking
Last year, niggas really feel like they rode on me
Last year, niggas got hot 'cause they told on me
I'm 'bout to call the bluff of anybody that fold on me
I'm buying the building of every door that closed on me
Yeah, Loro Piana and Brioni, the one and only
Champagne popper, the love doctor
Your baby mother call me when she lonely
My tailor see me twice a week, he like my homie
Forever grateful, forever thankful
Diamond necklace, but she wears it on her ankle
The bitch is trendy
My enemies send each other the texts that they could never send me
I'm banking two million a show for the residency
Nevada gaming commission in a frenzy
How much money can this casino lend me?
Ripping markers up over shots of the Henny
Vivid memory, can someone send me
A real nigga interlude? To me, Benihana is pigeon food
This not a forgiving mood
So much, we gotta count the 20s up in a different room
I am just a body that my brothers are living through
Keeping my connections strictly physical
Everyone that's married is miserable
I know that that is not a lifestyle I can give into
The rise to the top of this mountain has been biblical
I don't carry cash 'cause the money is digital
It's the American Expresser, the debt collector
Hailing all the way from the Mecca
Got something for Trudy and Rebecca
This shit could last forever
The mind controller, the Ayatollah
I built a bridge to success and had visions of me riding over
Step in the room and October gets a lot closer
Haunted houses, I don't know how to count in thousands, only millions
Now tell your friends I'm not the villian
Send 'em to Lagos or Turks and Caicos
Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago
Never go the same places they go
Separate vacations, a far cry from when Drizzy had slept in the basement
I was never on the path to get into Cambridge
I mean, I was good at doing math, but I'm better with language
Borderline dangerous, approach with caution
I plan to buy your most personal belongings when they up for auction
Man, truth be told, I think about it often
The petty king, the overseer of many things
I wish that I was playing in a sport where we were getting rings
I wouldn't have space on either hand for anything
West Hollywood, know my presence is menacing
Cosa Nostra, shady dealings
Racketeering, the syndicate got they hand in plenty things
The things that we've done to protect the name are unsettling
But no regrets though, the name'll echo
Years later, none greater
Death to a coward and a traitor, that's just in my nature, yeah


You finally start to care
I show up so unprepared
You're ready for something new
I'm still where I was last year
Meanwhile we're talking it out
You keep leaving things at my house
Seems like you're wanting to stay
But you need to know..

I'm on a wave, I'm on a ride
I'm everywhere, I'm hard to find
You want a man, I'm just a guy
Busy as fuck, you know what's up
Now got a life, back where I stay
Still pay a car note for this girl, around my way

You got the game and the talk
Keep turnin' out how I thought
Kept my feelings on low, all alone
Intuition never ever wrong
So what the hell, mix some vodka with Italian
Carousel, hitting circles I'm a stallion
And I'm a real one nigga, I'm my own med
You looking so damn thirsty, let me throw it back
Baby we are on to something, maybe if we had the time
Used to give my love for nothing, trust me, I'll be alright

I'm on a wave, I'm on a ride
I'm everywhere, I'm hard to find
You want a girl, I'm on my grind
Busy as fuck, you know what's up
I got a life, back where I stay
Alicias still my only girl around my way

I said baby, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it
Baby I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it
I'm on a wave, wave


Baby I like your style

Grips on your waist
Unruly me say
This sound just done the place
Streets not safe
Papi never run away
Even when he's away
Oti, oti, there's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray

That's why I need a one dance
Papi got that Hennessy in his hand
What sound can test? I don't know
Watch the whole dance get turned over
Said I need a one dance
Papi got that Hennessy in his hand
What sound can test? I don't know
Watch the whole dance get turned over

Mixpak sound
Baby I like your style
Ya unruly mudas!

Strength and guidance
Next soundbwoy is not my friend
Metro not smoke, so his yiy change
Unruly gang, worldwide ting
Don't know why they still try me
Bun Vegas, he cyaan reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
Unruly time

That's why I need a one dance
Drizzle got the machine in his hand
What sound can test? I don't know
Watch the whole dance get turned over
Said I need a one dance
Papi got that Hennessy in his hand
What sound can test? I don't know
Watch the whole dance get turned over, say

Got a pretty girl and she love me long time
Wine it, wine it, very long time
Oh yeah, very long time
My brudda
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Wicked, wicked, wicked
Back up, back up and wine it, girl
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Drizzy Drake, Popcaan, mudas
Oh yeah, very long time
Back, up, back up and wine it, girl


Look, I ain't never had a benzo
Nope, I pushed me an Ac wit the tintzo
Nosey niggas is peakin' in my window
Have a hard time looking
I tell you second hand that's a hard grind cooking
Cause my pop was in it so deep
If his son wanted in it these dealers would probably drop percentage
Instead, I drop bars like I'm two months sober
Its my time now so them you months over

Yeah if I want it I find me a way to get that
I'm trying to get to the point where I can sit back
Took a lot of patience and action
I grind so I'm anticipating relaxing
I'm thinking bout replacing the Jacksons on top of the charts
I don't need brothers fillin' space in the back than.
So from the kid with the sun tan flow
The hottest ticket in town to this one man show

I think that you know as well as I know
Bitches checkin' for me every where that I go
What you gotta understand that it's me I be
Until the motherfucking day that I D.I.E.

I can easily make'em admit to bounce back
Without knowing exactly where my accounts at
Yeah you best believe that I often tend to surpass what the rest achieve
So they don't like me and throw parties and yet they never invite me
I can't lie sometime it bother me slightly

Either way the true fans yell
I appear calm and its obvious so who can tell
And no this ain't Blu Cantrell
This is like perfection though we both got the light complexion
Couple things that I do that well
And the way that I Jack-son you think that Drake new Sam-L 
I've been real though 
They stay kicking it with me like a field goal
See I'm humble but I live vain
With more deals on the table than a bridge game


Too fire, that's where you go when I'm too dead and lonely
Why is it you run away when only (only)
I need you and you need me?
Boy, you know me, you know me
Showbiz, pulled us far apart but you're my favorite audience
Ooh and you applaud, you make me feel I'm a like a hit
Greatest ever lived, let's be passionate
Boy, don't run from this, I'm listening

Listen, seein' you got ritualistic (I know, I know)
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
'Cause I'm fallin' apart
(Fallin' apart, baby, don't fall apart)
Yep, tension between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won't mention for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
(Fallin' apart, baby, don't fall apart, passion)

Passionate from miles away (Passionate from mile away)
Passive with the things you say (Things I say)
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no (Please don't blame me now)
Passionate from miles away (Passionate from mile away)
Passive with the things you say (Things I say)
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no (Please don't blame me now)

Listen, hard at buildin' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
(Fallin' apart baby, don't fall apart)
Leavin', you're just doing that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart
(Fallin' apart baby, don't fall apart, passion)

Passionate from miles away (Passionate from mile away)
Passive with the things you say (Things I say)
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no (Please don't blame me now)
Passionate from miles away (Passionate from mile away)
Passive with the things you say (Things I say)
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no (Please don't blame me now)

Passionate from miles away
Passionate from miles
Passionate from miles away
Passionate from miles
I know you need me

You know I need you
You know I need you too
Chrisette Michele


Rapped in the warmth of you, loving every breathe of you
Feel my heart this moment, Ooohhh

Notebook, Notebook
Trapper keeper paper
Willy Wonka's in my closet, all these flavors
Shop with me you'll get exhausted
Broke nigga's they gotta dodge
They just can't afford it, yellow star ships
Walking out the men's department
Now look at that bitch riding with me, ain't she gorgeous
You 747, I be foreign, snoring
Paper like the NBA, balling
No look, big house, own cook
My chick exotic, bring what I want through
And I don't even tell them what I want
I just throw pool party's in my hotel room, and they come
Didn't know I'm famous, so she claim she ain't a groupie
You feed her Mc Donald's, I'm the kind like eating sushi
Got a lot of loose leaf (paper)
Come down to that money, Boy I'm straight, no chaser, okay

I'm burning purple flowers
It's burning my chest
I bury the most cash, and burning the rest 

Tryna get the green, like I'm waiting at a long light
Broke just doesn't suit me girl, and every night is prom night
Where'd I put my bow tie, millionaire multi
Rest in peace to B.I.G, and praises to the most high
Getting stupid paid, off of smart decisions
I'm the man now, I guess that parts a giving
Someone please tell me the problem, with my competition
I ask, "What's up?", and they just always say, "The cost to living"
I learn from it though, I been down, and I got up
Bring a hundred thousand to the club, and light yo' spot up
And me fallin' and landin' in love, I don't think should happen
Because everything easier to get into, than to get out of
But someone show me to the owner of this city
Cause the owner's always seen to be the only people with me
I'm still the mafa, I still run the committee
NY forever, nigga's did it (somebody remind me where I'm at)

I'm burning purple flowers
It's burning my chest
I bury the most cash, and burning the rest

And that champagne you've been sippin's
Not supposed to make you different all the time
It's starting to feel like the wrong thing to do girl
Cause with all that recognition it gets hard for you to listen
To the things that I must say to make you mine
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine
Trying to convince myself I've found one
Making the mistake I never learned from

You say that you're nothing like the last girl
I just pray that you don't let me down right now

You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break
And end up like before

Damn, yeah, I wonder why I never why I learned my lesson
It's feeling like the second chance and its the first impression
And I heard it's nothing new except for someone new
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you
Talking to myself but I never listen,
Cuz man it's been a while, and I swear that this ones different
That's why I'mma take you anywhere you wanna go
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again about
How reckless I have been
And I'm slowly running out of all the time that I invest in
Making all the same mistakes
And I'm just trying to correct it and I fall..

Tell me why I always fall for your type, for your type

You got me here watching minutes pass by 
Wondering when to expect you 
There you go is this a dream 
Looking like every picture that I've seen of you before 
Ive seen it all before now that its over 
Should have known better 
Then to think this was real 
And you could be mine 
Should have known better 
Slowed it down 
Cause I feel you needed time 
But I kept thinkin'
This could be something 
This could be 
This could be something 
Maybe its just nothing at all 
But this could be something 
This could be something 
This could be 
This could be something 
Maybe its just nothing at all 
At all 
Maybe its just nothing at all 
At all 
I guess its what we make it 


Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fuckin' here

I done kept it real from the jump
Livin' at my mamas house, we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was tryin' to get it on my own
Workin' all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle calling me like "Where ya at?
I gave you the keys told ya bring it right back
Nigga, I just think it's funny how it goes
Now Im on the road, half a million for a show
And we...

Boys tell stories about the man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it
Nigga, I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much I hear that's poppin' off without us
Nigga, we just want the credit where it's due
Imma worry about me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when Im in the house
Cause we...

No new niggas, nigga we dont feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where're your real friends at?
We dont like to do too much explainin'
Story stays the same, I never changed it
No new niggas, nigga we dont feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where're your real friends at?
We dont like to do too much explainin'
Story stay the same through the money and the fame
Cause we...

Came in the game, went online and it changes
These fuck niggas'll say it in ten different ways
Then see you and smile in your face
You wanna meet up, name a time or a place
Im smokin' that fire, my nigga you know that its fire
You smell it as soon as I blaze
Burnin' a pound, burnin' a pound, burnin' a pound
Yeah, its goin' down, its goin' down, its goin' down
Started from the bottom now we here
Had a dream bout a car, and went and got it in a year
All black trucks when we pull up to the Lear
All black Coupe, I look like Bruce when Im steerin'
Hope the homie Drake dont get pissed
But niggas never ever put your man on songs like this
And I probably said no to it before
But I made 20 millions so we should probably go on tour
And I just seen Waka the other day
He wasnt trippin', we just talked about the money we been makin'
Cause we


I did it all on my own,
Turned a chair to a throne,
I'm a king in this world,
(Stunt hard)
I put my whole city on,
To some things that they never would've known,
If I didn't,
(Stunt hard)
And every night is a premiere,
If I ever dissapear,
Best believe I'm comin' back.
(Stunt hard)
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again,
On that same shit again,
All I ever do is,
(Stunt hard)

I tell her.
I'm getting motherfuckin' busy.
So many spins my records is motherfuckin' dizzy.
Haters wanna turn to their girl and be like, "Who is he?"
But I bet a million she tell you that's motherfuckin' Drizzy.
And I'm focused on my survival.
Keep an eye on the door, focus on my arrival.
Who do you look up to when you're better then your idol?
And how you 'posed to look when you do it with your eyes closed.
I'm everything you just haven't become.
I spend my time trying to outdo what hasn't been done.
Now hopefully let them see,
What they say that I'm gon' be,
And if not our whole future does in the memory of me.
Get your team in order, assembly is key.
And all my niggas shut up at the mention of a plea.
They rather be apprehended and keep quiet then to be,
On the stand jeopardizing every inch of their loyalty.
Pick a lane pick a lane. That's all I ever heard.
But I'm just trying to swerve.
Without hitting the curb.
That's why I spend thousands on bottles so I can pop them.
And take photos wit hater niggas and crop them.
I am not them. I photoshop them, out.
'Cause they don't understand what I'm about.
Yeah.
The Chris Paul
Of this fall,
Sittin' this tall.
I float high,
Goodbye,
I will miss y'all.

I did it all on my own,
Turned a chair to a throne,
I'm a king in this world,
(Stunt hard)
I put my whole city on,
To some things that they never would've known,
If I didn't,
(Stunt hard)
And every night is a premiere,
If I ever dissapear,
Best believe I'm comin' back.
(Stunt hard)
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again,
On that same shit again,
All I ever do is,
(Stunt hard)

If I don't do nothin', I'ma stunt my ass off.
Money sittin' in the pocket, 'bout to get a passoff.
And I smoke that shit that smell like when you take your cast off.
And I got them beach bitches, like David Hasselhoff.
Baby I'm an acrobat. Sweetie, I'm a stuntdevil.
You can't get on my level 'cause I am so unleveled.
I'm a young rebel.
And I got a babyface.
I need a young Pebbles.
I need a stuntdouble.
Yeah!
Me, Drake and Kid and you know it's trouble.
We got 'em drownin' in the flow, you see 'em blowin' bubbles.
Yeah!
I stick my landin' in a freak drawers.
I'll have her bouncin' back like Dominique Dawes.
Yeah!
But I ain't stuntin' these hoes
I been pimpin' since Hulk Hogan was N.W.O.
Yeah!
I'm wild, Drizzy tough, and the Kid vicious.
The three horseman, we just need Sid Vicious.
Yeah!
I'm on the cup of that tilt.
And if you hatin' on me
I'll say fuck you like Wilt.
Yeah!
Im a wild-erbeast. You're just a wilderbeast.
My two fingers make a gun, that shoot and kill ya peace.
Yeah!
Talkin' big big shit.
I am rude,
I take food,
From a kid picnic.
Nigga.
Yeah!
And we can bang like bumper cars.
You know I stunt shit 'cause I write all Stunna bars.
Haha.

I did it all on my own,
Turned a chair to a throne,
I'm a king in this world,
(Stunt hard)
I put my whole city on,
To some things that they never would've known,
If I didn't,
(Stunt hard)
And every night is a premiere,
If I ever dissapear,
Best believe I'm comin' back.
(Stunt hard)
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again,
On that same shit again,
All I ever do is,
(Stunt hard)

I stunt hard. I stunt harder.
Boy they call me Jackie Chan in New Orleans.
I ball hard. So I'm a ball hogger.
And I go hard and I dunk like Vince Carter.
I hustle harder.
I live in the Carter.
I think forward,
All I see is tommorow.
I need meat.
I'll turn your shop into a horror.
So if you trying to see more
Better feed me.
I'm back on my grizzy like Izzy Efeger.
Don't he look like a black grizzly in that black fur?
And the Feds will never get me,
Like a backwards,
Password,
Black spur,
Go some like Pacman, cats first.
Vanilla Ice got 'em hangin over the banister
Ask her,
Am I their man,
Her answer,
Is yessir.
Shit.
I'm tourin' state to state
I played the RTA
'Bout a quarter a day.
Now tell them bitches.

I did it all on my own,
Turned a chair to a throne,
I'm a king in this world,
(Stunt hard)
I put my whole city on,
To some things that they never would've known,
If I didn't,
(Stunt hard)
And every night is a premiere,
If I ever dissapear,
Best believe I'm comin' back.
(Stunt hard)
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again,
On that same shit again,
All I ever do is,
(Stunt hard)

New stories for you every time the phone ring
They don't understand, girl if anything you're everything
Oh lord, good lord, smoke a little, then record
You know Papi on the vocals, 40 on the boards
Call me when you feel inspired, never when you're bored
And have a real conversation with your fuckin' boy
With the fuckin' man, Mr. Lover-Lover-Man
How come everything is on the other hand?
How come you ain't never busy when I'm busy
But the moment that I'm free you always end up with some other plans?
How you make a good dude wait so long?
I don't understand why, that's some girl shit
And what you doin' in the bedroom with your clothes on?
I want you wearin' what you came into the world with

I've been out walking
I don't do too much talking these days
These days
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things, I forgot to do

These days

I've met some women
I wish I had resisted these days
These days
These days I seem to think
About how I have failed
To change all of my ways

These days

Yeah, I had a lover
Don't think I'd risk another
These days
These days
And if I seem to be afraid
Just listen to the life I've made in songs

These days

I've stopped the dreaming
I don't do too much scheming
These days
These days
I sit inside chauffeur car
With windows down and count the stars
These days
These days


Had hit records on my demo
Did y'all boys not get the memo?
I do not stay at the Intercontinental
And anything I got is not a rental
I own that mu'fucka
Figured out this shit is simple
My stock been going up like a crescendo
A bunch of handshakes from the fakes
But nigga, I do not wanna be friends though
I told y'all mu'fuckas
Man, this shit is not a love song
This a "fuck-a-stripper-on-the-mink-rug" song
This a "fuck-them-boys, forever-hold-a-grudge" song
"Pop-some-fucking-champagne-in-the-tub" song
Nigga, "just-because" song
Damn

What's the move? Can I tell the truth?
If I was doing this for you then I'd have nothing left to prove
Nah, this for me though
I'm just tryna stay alive and take care of my people
And they don't have no award for that
Trophies, trophies
And they don't have no award for that
Shit don't come with trophies, ain't no envelopes to open
I just do it cause I'm 'sposed to, nigga

Bitch I go to Dreams with a suitcase
I got my whole country on a new wave
She like "I heard all your niggas stay where you stay"
House so big I haven't seen them boys in two days
Bitch, I use a Walkie-Talkie just to get a beverage
I saw my parents split up right after the wedding
That taught my ass to stay committed, fuck the credit
Bitch check the numbers, I'm the one who really get it
I told y'all mu'fuckas
Man, this shit is not a love song
This a "doing-me-and-only-God-can-judge" song
"I-do-not-know-what-the-fuck-you-thought-it-was" song
"Pop-some-fucking-champagne-in-the-tub" song
Nigga, "just because" song
Damn

What's the move? Can I tell the truth?
If I was doing this for you then I'd have nothing left to prove
Nah, this for me though
I'm just tryna stay alive and take care of my people
And they don't have no award for that
Trophies, trophies
And they don't have no award for that
Shit don't come with trophies, ain't no envelopes to open
I just do it cause I'm 'sposed to, nigga


Yeah
Yeah, more
Yeah

More time with family and friends, more life
More time to get it right
It's only me but I'm seeing four shadows in the light
My demons visit me every night
To the most high I'm forever indebted
I know I gotta pay something, I know that day's coming
I put it all in the music
Because if I don't say it here then I won't say nothing
Could feel my hand getting tired from holding the grudges
Two birds, one stone, my aim is amazing
I need to start losing my shit
Just to show you niggas who hatin'
Too reserved like I called ahead for me and my lady
Free C5, how the fuck we got the boss waiting
Ever since the blue basement I found God and I lost patience
Between rocks and hard places of all places
Spotted everywhere like Dalmation
Cops snoop around cause all my dogs famous
Please welcome the October fall baby
Vaughan Road Academy, star playermy mind's not all there
Used to carry a lot of dead weight like a pallbearer
People too scared to tell the truth so it's all dares
Counted us all there and we all square
Quick money, I'm in and out
My dad used to use a soap bar till it's thinning out
But shit, look at Dennis now
All Stacy Adams and linnen'd out
More blessings for Sandy and him, more life
My parents never got it right, but
God bless 'em both, I think we all alike
We all wide awake late at night, thinking on what to change
If we do get to do it twice in a another life
Scared to go to sleep now
Cause being awake is what all my dreams were like
Back when the bar I set for myself was out of sight
Tell me how I went and did chin ups
On this shit when I can't see it
Pin ups of Meagan Good and Pam Grier, soul sisters
Inspired my old scriptures
Now that feeling gone like them old pictures
Mixing liquors got us both twisted
Words get so vicious, you just stare at me
While you roll swishers
Girl I love you, but I don't miss you
And no matter what year it is I'm an old 6'er
Go figure, cold nigga, stay in school man
Fuck the rap game, it's all lies and it's all filthy
2 percent of us rich and the rest of these niggas all milk it
Got two of my niggas off with a not guilty
Gave back to the city and never said it
If I didn't live it but still they try to tell you I'm not the realest
Like I'm some privileged kid that never sat through a prison visit
Or like it was just handed to me tied with a ribbon
I never worked to get it
But really it's you with all the drug dealer stories
That's gotta stop though
You made a couple chops and now you think you Chapo
If you ask me though you ain't lining the trunk with kilos
You bagging weed watching Pacino with all your niggas
Like "this what we need to be on," but you never went live
You middle man in this shit, boy you was never them guys
I can tell cause I look most of you dead in your eyes
And you'll be trying to sell that story for the rest of your lives
Can't show us where the cash is
Me, I don't judge, I'm just going off what the math is
Numbers inflated
They all look at me like, "What have you done for me lately?
I like your older shit but wasn't in love with the latest"
Awe baby, stop debating, I'm just a creative
My numbers out of this world
No wonder they got me feeling so alienated
You were the man on the moon
Now you just go through your phases
Life of the angry and famous
Rap like I know I'm the greatest
Then give you the tropical flavors
Still never been on hiatus
You stay xanned and perked up
So when reality set in you don't gotta face it
I'm down 200 in Vegas but winning life on a daily basis
It seems like nobody wants to stay in my good graces
I'm like a real estate agent, putting you all in your places
Look what happens soon as you talk to me crazy
Is you crazy?


Yeah, they try to send for me
Envy and jealousy is everything I wish upon my enemies
All that for them, right back at them
What my mind keeps telling me
Mind keeps telling me
I hear everything, I don't answer cause it's all there cause it better be
Trust me it better be, no long talking or settling
Just when I've never won no wrestling
But he's on a big belt medal ting
Streets unruly
More life for my brother's trying out better things, cause

All my man dem are running to the money
We be running like ay, ay, ay, ay
And all my man dem are running from them hoes in the roads like whoa whoa whoa, whoa
Like whoa, a month ago you didn't wanna know, but now I'm seeing dough
These catties they be calling up my phone
All these man dem and they applaud me on the road

I put corn in for my bro
Man dem keep on talking on a low
Man dem keep talkin on a low, but all my man are bros
All my man, all my man are bros
My man dem will have your man dem on the ropes
I'll have man dem on your roads
Man dem in a batch on they own
With a bat or with a pole
I got man dem that will slap a man with both
Nike jacket on my back i'm looking cold
It's funny how these catties wanna know, but

All my man dem are running to the money
We be running like ay, ay, ay, ay
And all my man dem are running from them hoes in the roads like whoa whoa whoa, whoa
Like whoa, a month ago you didn't wanna know, but now I'm seeing dough
These catties they be calling up my phone
All these man dem and they applaud me on the road

Free Smoke
Anybody want it they can get it, no joke
Call up landlord, nigga that's broke
I only link with the real ones, lord knows
On fo', I love to see a fake nigga go broke
I don't run to Twitter with the things I know
I fall back to see how it unfolds
Yeah, like whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Like whoa, years ago they didn't wanna know
But now I'm seeing dough
Catties they be calling up my phone
Trying to get tickets to a show
Yeah, I got U.K. tings on the WhatsApp now
Like +44 on the road

Like whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Like whoa
A month ago you didn't wanna know, but now I'm seeing dough
These catties they be calling up my phone
All these man dem they applaud me on the road
I put corn in for my bro
Man dem keep on talking on a low
Man dem keep talkin on a low, low, low


The only thing I'm seein' I'd like to put an amend on, perhaps a little more room here for the fixins, you know what I'm talkin' about? Oh, we gon' have a lot of fixins. We gonna have so many fuckin' fixins up in this motherfucker, this shit gon' go through the roof. Got damn I'm shittin' gold these days

Nigga we made it, hey
We made it
Nigga we made it, hey
Damn, we made it
Nigga we made it, hey
We made it, aye
Nigga we made it, hey
We made it

She said she workin' for Walgreens but not in the store, at the head office
The head was so good it makes sense why you work at the head office
In 2007 I sat in the lobby of Motown and waited
Now I walk into the buildin' and go off like "Nigga we made it!"
When I walk through these halls, man this beat should be playin'
I just came to make sure you not missin' no payments
Now turn this shit down while I issue my statement
It needed a moment of silence, nigga we made it!
You fly out your lady, I fly out my latest
Bitches can't front on the kid anymore, man they know what my name is
And if by chance she don't know who I am, she just know that I'm famous
Imma just hand her a business card and say "Nigga we made it!"
And she gotta come through the hotel and pop it off for me
Then she gon' text her best friend like "Girl he got some good dick and money"
Her friend hit her back like "I know that already, that nigga's amazin'"
Then I send a message to both of they asses like "Nigga we made it!"

Kinda makes me wonder why the hell so many people are tryna tell me to slow down. Seems like motherfuckers should be shuttin' the hell up and enjoyin' the show

Hey
We made it
Nigga we made it, hey
Damn, we made it
Nigga we made it, hey
We made it, aye
Nigga we made it, hey
We made it

If they with me, just know that they wit' it and 'bout it
If I said it, I meant it, it's no way around it
OVO, Reps Up, and P. Reign is next up watch Gway go crazy
When Baka came home for the holidays, I was like "Nigga we made it!"
And all of those lawyer fees, nigga I paid it
My family get all of my loyalty, all of my patience
My life for your life, man I wouldn't trade it
I would just look at you dead in yo' face and say "Nigga we made it!"
I swear that we made it, sell out that ting, I'm the king in Jamaica
But I've been on that wave, that's why this year I tell yah, I don't need no favors
(Damn, Soulja Boy stunt on them haters)
And my resolution for New Years is nigga we made it!
You don't know how long I waited, I coulda been waitin' on tables, my karma's amazin'
I'm out in the Caymans, rented a 12-bedroom house just to sleep all the women we came with
That's ignorant, ain't it? Sometimes I question myself when I think 'bout the pictures I painted
Then I pick up my brush and I sign at the bottom like "Nigga we made it!"

Hey
We made it
Nigga we made it, hey
Damn, we made it
Nigga we made it, hey
We made it, aye
Nigga we made it, hey
We made it

I remember standing in the hood
Tellin' my partner, and my momma, everything gonna be all good
Nigga we made it! Damn, I'm up in Las Vegas
Damn, I never was supposed to have shit, now my life is lavish
Every night, fuckin' a bad bitch, nigga we made it!
Coppin' a Lambo, cash, the Bentley, 2 times I crashed
Ha, nigga we made it!
Look at them niggas' faces, them niggas, they hate it
I look a nigga in his face and say "Nigga we made it!"
Soulja Boy stunt on them haters
And these days I don't need no favors
Nigga we made it!


What if I kissed you right now
How would we explain it
Trying to imagine how it might sound
If I just yelled out

What if I kissed you right now
Would it bring us any closer
Take the weight off of our shoulders
Take me I'm yours
And I don't really care who knows it
Can we afford to be that open with all these emotions

If you were a secret
How long could you keep it
Keep it to yourself
Don't tell nobody else

Nothing but mine,
Talking 'bout mine,
Now you're all mine
And you you, you

And you just be mine (just be mine)

Would it bring us any closer
Take the weight off of our shoulders
Tell on me I don't mind
'Cause if they ask me about it I won't lie

Admit that I'm yours
I don't really care who knows it
Can we afford
To be that open with all these emotions

If we were a secret
Tell me could you keep it?
Keep it to yourself
Don't tell nobody else

Nothin' but mine,
Talking 'bout mine,
Now you're all mine
And you you, you

Just be mine (just be mine)
And you just be mine all mine
And you just be mine (just, just be mine)
And you just be mine all mine yeah

If we were a secret
Tell me could you keep it?
Keep it to yourself
Don't tell nobody else

Nothing but mine,
Talking 'bout mine,
Now you're all mine
And you you, you

Just be mine (just be mine)
And you just be mine all mine

There, now hold me close
There, now hold me close
There, now hold me close
There, now hold me close
There, now hold me close
There, now hold me close

I just want to take you there
He don't gotta know where
Does he touch you here like this?
Let me take the friction from your lips

And I'mma love you girl, the way you need
Ain't no one gon' stop us, ain't no one gon' stop us
And I'm gon' give you girl, what you fiend
I'm the drug in your veins, just fight through the pain
He's what you want, he's what you want
He's what you want, he's what you want
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need
He's what you want, he's what you want
He's what you want, he's what you want
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need

I got everything you want with me
I do everything he does times three
And he don't gotta know
I got you on the floor, doing things you never thought you'd do
Baby, leave them high heel shoes
Cause I love it when you're looking down at me, I'm looking up at you
And I don't give a damn shorty, watch me knock your boots off

And I'mma love you girl, the way you need
Ain't no one gon' stop us, ain't no one gon' stop us
And I'm gon' give you girl, what you fiend
I'm the drug in your veins, just fight through the pain
He's what you want, he's what you want
He's what you want, he's what you want
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need
He's what you want, he's what you want
He's what you want, he's what you want
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need


I have to watch the road
I swear that every car that passes has you in it
I can't believe we're finished
My life is movin' fast
The time will often pass
And something will remind me
I can't put this behind me
I thought you would've called by now, by now
You could've had my all by now, by now
It's been too many years for you to disappear
And have me asking the question

I wonder whatever became of you
(Although) It's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try
It's not that I was frightened (of you)
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you

I swear I heard you call
But when I heard you'd gone
I hate that I looked desperate
You gone is like me naked
I'm steering not to crash
Trying to make it last
Keep looking close behind me
My eyesight on a memory
I thought you would've called by now, by now
You could have all my love right now, by now
Gave into my fears
While you just disappeared
That's why I'm asking this question...

I wonder whatever became of you
(Although) It's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try
It's not that I was frightened (of you)
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you

I can't go to bed
Thinking about my goals
And how we used to say a goal is just a dream with a deadline
Where did the other half of my heart go?
Why am I in bed alone?
How come when I drive by, it looks like you are never home?
Do you even live there?
Or did you take a u-haul?
Too far, move off and not even tell me that you're gone?
We were on fire
Somehow that fire cooled off, burnt out
I kept straight, but I wonder how you turned out

I wonder whatever became of you
(Although) It's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try
It's not that I was frightened (of you)
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you


I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure

How you feel about coming home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fucking out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?

Tongue kisses, stank hoes at the Coachella
Thank the Lord she never listen what a hoe tell her
Not only could I do better, but I know better
How could I ever be the king without a Coretta?
Feeling like Rae, same damn Lo sweater
MAC 10, Beretta for the cold weather
Her ex let her blow cheddar, she a go getter
Hoe, clothes fit her, more wetter, but her flow better
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Keep machine gun strapped in case a nigga wanna act up
Petite gun raps ain't even strong enough to match us
Machine gun BLAT in case a nigga wanna act tough
Ain't nothing like a bad bitch
That make a jiggy nigga wanna go and run up in that shit raw
Like Brother Man from the 5th floor
I creep up in it, deep up in it 'til she tell a nigga, It's yours
I know this shit is mine for the taking
If I ain't a Mason it's some gay shit
Prolly why I don't react when you say this shit
Half the times niggas don't even make sense
Know this shit is yours
When you do a world tour all off a mixtape shit
You know this shit is yours
When your face on every magazine cover, every page shit
You know this shit is yours
When you fuck a new different bad broad every day shit
Only get high just to compliment my maintenance
I took a little moment out to say this


Listen girl, you so bad and you single
Whats this I hear, we ain't met yet
My name Drake and Ima take the world over, this my year
This I swear, had my share of women that I been with
Im young, can you blame me
I know you feel like a lot of things off limits
At least let me describe what it can be
Be faithful, I do that, not really baby girl
Ill do that
Cause everybody break up when the cake up
We can be the couple thatll never go through that
Yeah and if were ever falling off
I swear Ill remind you that were not who they are
Now all I really gotta do is find you
Where you at?

From the east to the west, scream for me if your my number one lady
Take a lead in the race you can go fast speed it up for me baby
Ima a G, whats next? One night with me would drive you crazy (crazy)
One night with me would drive you crazy.
Starters are you ready, take your marks and get steady
You know that its about to get heavy
Cause shes a rider (a rider)
My Yamaha mama 
Aye aye

Tell me how I locate you
I know satellites are a breakthrough
But they dont really lead me straight to
And I gotta arrive fore somebody take you
Know theres someone you dont mean a lot to
And you would hate to know that I got you
I even got a speech in my head that write
and recite at the moment I spot you
Hey there, your name is?
I like that, it suits ya
Im young but Im different
Im not what your used to at all
If we stop at the same red light
Ima celebrate the fact that I found you girl
And Ima ride for ya too as soon as it turn green
Wanna hear from all my ladies from around the world
Where you at?


Uhh, yea
Uh uh uh
Alright, well alright

I say I do it for the love
Bunk bed flow,
Always one level above
If I'm in your starting five
You'll never need a sub,
And I'm never looking down,
So I always know watsup,
A picture won't do me justice,
League in this bitch, Ima do me trust this,
Patience little label nigga you won't rush this,
I got the hand on my money sweetie, you can't touch this,

I got a revolutionary flow in every scenario,
Coming through your stereo
Bust my girlfriend booty 'round like the merry-go,
Bitches like where he at, they be like there he go.
And this verse deserve a burial.
Don't cry for me, this ain't ma'fuckin' mario,

Yea, and polo isn't at my session
Mr. anticipation Ima keep you niggas guessing like..

Ok, ok, I'm grown, grown
Party at my house but I'm home, alone
Doing every single thing my momma wouldn't condone,
Counting everything I own, in my ma'fucking zone

I'm up too high, somebody come get me down, down
Down, down
Said I'm up too high, somebody come get me down, down
Down, down

Yo, my ex-girl say she done dating black guys,
She shoulda listened when her white friends advised
But not me I'll make your battleship capsize,
Get soaked, get wet, get baptized,

I got the full package, a nigga complete,
I give bread, and eat tracks like lunchmeat,
Pursue me and ill put you on front street
Probably get your record pushed back like front seats 
I'm much more than you'd fathom me would be,
There ain't too many niggas I'd rather be than me,
I guarantee those women gettin' at him would agree,
That he should go ahead put a patent on his G and,
I swear these niggas gassed up even tho the price is high.
I could own half as much clothing and be twice as fly,
Yea, you know my coupe sits super low,
Tops slip off like janet at the superbowl

Ok, ok, I'm grown, grown
Party at my house but I'm home, alone
Doing every single thing my momma wouldn't condone,
Counting everything I own, in my ma'fucking zone

I'm up too high, somebody come get me down, down
Down, down
Said I'm up too high, somebody come get me down, down
Down, down

Cus I'm a beast.
