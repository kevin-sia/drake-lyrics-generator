I can still feel the love

We not worried 'bout no other niggas, we them other niggas
You bust down a Rollie, I bust down a brick, then I flood it, nigga
I am not to be compared to you rappers (Eazy-Duz-It) nigga
I am more Eazy, you tryin' your best to become me, nigga
She like them bottles with bubbles in it
Buy her Loewe and other linen
Why would I wait when there's other women?
Why would I hate? We in love with winnin', ooh
Buy her bundles, fly her out, bring her friend, I try her out
Ain't no worries findin' out, the details is ironed out
Easily they plays along, hopin' that I play a song
Love to fuck to trap music (feel the love)

I love all your shit talkin', I love all your shit talkin'
You ain't got nothin' better to... do with yourself?

I done proved to myself, back on that rulin' myself
I got new news to tell, act like you knew you done failed
Only true know how I feel and only if you knew how I felt
Sniffed a lil' bootch off the nail
Through with mixed messages, through with the mail
Only a few in the field, little bit off for the real

It's so many days I prayed to God
All this pain, I couldn't seem to find a way
On a mission livin', carry on
Got my family, I'm seein' through by the days
Never late, pull up a seat and come grab a plate
Check the date, let 'em hate
This the type shit that they couldn't make, watch the fakes
Leave 'em buzzin', thought they wasn't, huh?
Tell all your kinfolk and cousins, huh?
This is the package you ordered, huh?
Beautiful madness

On this road I find, hmm-mmm
These scars I left behind, hmm-mmm
Heaven, lift me up, hmm-mmm
Heaven, lift me up, hmm-mmm
On this road I find, hmm-mmm
These scars I left behind, hmm-mmm
Heaven lift me up, hmm-mmm
Heaven lift me up, hmm-mmm


"Down the chimney, he will come
With his great big smile
And you'll find that even the kiddies
Are swingin' in the latest style
Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringing?
Oh, oh, oh
I wonder whether he'll be swingin'"

It feels so good, it should cost
Bought an alligator, I ain't talkin' Lacoste
Made me say, "Ooh, uh"
Like I'm mixing Master P and Rick Ross (uh, uh)
She seem to make me always feel like a boss (uh, uh)
She said I'm in the wrong hole, I said I'm lost (uh, uh)
She said I'm goin' too fast, I'm exhausted
Now drop to your knees for the offerin'
This the theme song, oh somethin' wrong
Might need an intervention for this new dimension
That's too new to mention, or fit in a sentence
If I get locked up, I won't finish the sent—

"Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringin'?
Oh, oh, oh
I wonder whether he'll be swingin'"

Gettin' loose while I'm on the deuce, see me roll out
What you surf, hit the coast, and this feelin', I got
Plenty of adventures for the evenin', we go journey, we off
From the light to guide us home, we in the moment, oh-oh
Such a lost boy, caught up in the darkest I had
What's the cost, boy? Losin' everything that I had
She been on me, boy, unless you got somethin' to tell
Sittin', waitin' for me slippin', yeah, I'll see you in hell
Tell the cougar get up off me, no, my soul ain't for sale
All the evils in the world, they keepin' on me for real
I really hope the Lord won't hurt me, we all live in sin
Kids see ghost off the ropes, Ric Flair on your bitch
Now this the theme song, this the theme song
The put the beams on, get your, get your dream on
But you don't hear me though, drama: we let it go
Watch the guitars roll and let your friends know

"Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringin'?
Oh, oh, oh
I wonder whether he'll be swingin'"

"Just do that and then let the music do somethin', then do that again, that'd be enough for a record
I mean, you only want two and a half minutes if you can get it, you know, three minutes max—"


May I say something to you to give you a true knowledge of yourself and life?
Man in the full knowledge of himself is a superb and supreme creature of creation
When man becomes possessor of the knowledge of himself, he becomes the master of his environment

I don't feel pain anymore
Guess what, baby? I feel freeee (scoop!)
Nothin' hurts me anymore
Guess what, baby? I feel freeee

I'm so complete anymore

Guess what, baby? I feel freeee
And you know damn well

He lift me up every time that I fell
And set me freeee, yeah

Ah! You should quit your job to this

Hold up, that'll politic, ooh
One day they hate you
Next day they love you
I'm still yellin' "fuck you"
I could never trust—

Freeee, I feel freeee
I feel freeee, I feel freeee

I don't feel pain anymore
Guess what, babe? I am freeee
Yeah, nothin' hurts me anymore
Guess what, babe? I am freeee

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Feelin' out of my past life
Died and came back twice
Now I'm freeee

I don't feel pain anymore
Hmm, guess what, babe? I am freeee

I feel freeee, I feel freeee
I feel freeee, I feel freeee


I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward

Very rarely do you catch me out
Ya'll done "specially invited guest"'d me out
Y'all been tellin' jokes that's gon' stress me out
Soon as I walk in, I'm like, "Let's be out"
I was, off the chain, I was often drained
I was off the meds, I was called insane
What a awesome thing, engulfed in shame
I want all the rain, I want all the pain
I want all the smoke, I want all the blame
Cardio audio, let me jog your brain
Caught in the Audy Home, we was all detained
All of you Mario, it's all a game

I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward

I had my issues, ain't that much I could do
But, peace is somethin' that starts with me, with me
At times, wonder my purpose
Easy then to feel worthless
But, peace is somethin' that starts with me (with me, with me)
Had so much on my mind, I didn't know where to go
I've come a long way from them hauntin' me
Had me feelin' oh so low
Ain't no stoppin' you no way
All things, the night before
Ain't no stoppin' you no way
No stress yes, I'm so blessed and-

I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward

Movin' forward, movin' forward, movin' forward
Keep movin' forward (somethin's wrong)
Keep movin' forward (I don't know why)
Keep movin' forward (so long)
Keep movin' forward (sit here in the storm)
Keep movin' forward (time goes on)
Keep movin' forward (been lookin' for my way out)
Keep movin' forward (from the storm)
Keep movin' forward (which way do I go?)

I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward (which way do I go?)
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward (which way do I go?)
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward (which way do I go?)
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward


Find my back in the cold
Trapped in another soul, they can hear me holler
I'm colder than the game
See 'em all strapped in an' can't move and I'm sinkin' lower
Heaven gonna help me
'Cause I feel the world weighin' on me heavy, tryna keep it steady
Ready for the mission
God, shine your love on me, save me, please
If I'm goin' alone, I've been gone for so long
Ain't nobody, you can't hear a word
Perched in the night, lookin’ out nowhere
Where's home on this hidden earth?
Pain in my eyes, in the time I find, I'm stronger than I ever was
Here we go again, God, shine your love on me, save me, please

(Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)
Stay strong

Everybody want world peace
'Til your niece get shot in the dome-piece
Then you go and buy your own piece
Hopin' it'll help you find your own peace
Bring light to what they don't see
Auntie cryin' on the concrete
Talkin' to dispatcher then the phone beep
On the other line was the homies
Told her that you ain't comin' home, see
When she heard the news it hurt her bone-deep
Caught with the rifle with the long reach
Just another cycle of the lonely
All growin' up in environment
Where doin' crime the requirement
They send us off to prison for retirement
Hopefully Alice Johnson will inspire men
