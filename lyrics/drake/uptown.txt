Yeah, uh-huh

Uh, hardly home but always repping
You hardly on and always second
When I'm awake you always resting
And when they call you the answer
You are hardly questioned

I, I'm doing classic shit in all my sessions
Other niggas situations they are all depressing
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions
I just always did my own thing

Now I run the game, you stupid mothersuckers
I see all this money through my Ohio state buck eyes
Shit been going good, but good could turn to better
'Cause you the type to lose her
And I'm about to get her

It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK
You can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
Best believe I understand

It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK
You can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
You can run and tell my city it's on

Yeah, wrong way down a one way
Women don't get saved 'round me even on a Sunday
Damn where I get it from, these niggas always wonder who
Then they meet my pop and tell 'em "Drake is just a younger you."

And shorty wanna party so don't let your girl up out the house
Or there'll be shots on TMZ, of me giving her mouth-to-mouth
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her
I drop two black cars I named 'em Malcolm X and Martin Luther

I don't ever play but I'm in the game lady
They just lose to love, those are tennis games lady
Have you counting money going dufflebag-crazy
Sipping on Pink Floyd and puffing Wayne Brady

Damn, whose line is it anyways?
I'm in a daze
You been amazed
Y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage
I'm on fire yup I've been a blaze

I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right
You look nice
And your frame makes me wanna bowl a strike
Well, alright
Guess I might
Know what? Fuck it. Yes, I will
I am more than what you bargained for
And nothing less than real
Put it to your life

It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK
You can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
Best believe I understand

It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK
You can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
You can run and tell my city it's on

Bun B, king of the trill
Also one of the dopest
Whether the streets or on the mic
I'm dope and yes I'm focused

The gangster recognize me for my locc ness no joke it's
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a locust

Or maybe like a python
That's the type of shit I'm on
I wrote this on my iPhone
So let me drop this iBomb

I palm the game like it's a spalding ball and take flight
From the free throw line and slam it down like I'm the great Mike

Bun and Wayne and Drake in here
Man this gon' be a great night
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white

Try to cross me over
I just fake left then I break right
Stupid animal tricks
Like David Letterman's Late Night

This that major moment you've been waiting on for too long
The best that ever did it and doing it on a new song
UGK and Young Money too strong
Bound to be in the green like a crouton
So what the fuck is you on?

It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK
You can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
Best believe I understand

It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK
You can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
You can run and tell my city it's on

I am the leather-jacket, black-glasses, All-American bad boy
I own the swagger supermarket and you, you just a bag boy
'Cause I got that swag boy, the swag you never had boy
Hate and I will leave your chest the color of my flag boy

Soowoo bitch, I do this shit, I'll erase you like I drew you bitch
And I keep that toaster you can come and be my strudel bitch

I'm so uptown
And motherfucker if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeah
And now I'm on that rock shit
But why they let me in
I'm a start shooting in a mosh pit

Fuck is you talking 'bout
Weezy in your mouth now
Weezy what you talking 'bout
(Young Mula Baby)

It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK
You can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
Best believe I understand

It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK
You can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
You can run and tell my city it's on
