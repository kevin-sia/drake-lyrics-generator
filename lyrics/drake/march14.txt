Here we go
Yeah

Yesterday morning was crazy
I had to come to terms with the fact that it's not a maybe
That shit is in stone, sealed and signed
She not my lover like Billie Jean but the kid is mine
Sandi used to tell me all it takes is one time, and all it took was one time
Shit, we only met two times, two times
And both times were nothing like the new times
Now it's rough times
I'm out here on front lines just trying to make sure that I see him sometimes
It's breaking my spirit
Single father, I hate when I hear it
I used to challenge my parents on every album
Now I'm embarrassed to tell them I ended up as a co-parent
Always promised the family unit
I wanted it to be different because I've been through it
But this is the harsh truth now
Fairy tales are saved for the bedtime stories I tell you now
I don't want you worry about whose house you live at
Or who loves you more, or who's not there
Who did what to who 'fore you got here
Now, look, I'm too proud to let that come between me and you now
Realize I got to think for two now, I gotta make it, I better make it
I promise if I'm not dead then I'm dedicated
This the first positive DNA we ever celebrated
I can't forget the looks on they faces
Got the news in Miami that we all now got ones that we raisin'
Tell Gelo bring some, uh, Rosé and Baccarat out for our cheers to the next generation
But this champagne toast is short-lived
I got an empty crib in my empty crib
I only met you one time, introduced you to Saint Nick
I think he must've brought you like twenty gifts
Your mother say you growing so fast that they don't even really fit
But man, you know, I still had to get it for my boy though, you know
You haven't met your grandfather yet, that nigga a trip
He probably coulda did stand-up
But at the same time he's a stand up
And that's how you gonna be when it's time to man up
October baby for irony sake, of course
I got this 11 tatted for somebody, now it's yours
And believe me, I can't wait to get a hunnid more
Sorry I'm vintage, tryna cover ground
They said that in two weeks you're supposed to come in town
Hopefully by the time you hear this me and your mother will have come around instead of always cutting each other down

God willing, I got a good feeling
You got a good spirit
We'll talk more when you hear this
My G

No one to cry on
I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain
To ease the pain
I'm changing from boy to a man
No one to cry on
I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain
To ease the pain
I'm changing from boy to a man
I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain
To ease the pain
I'm changing from boy to a man
