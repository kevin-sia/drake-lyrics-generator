Really?
Yeah (Six!)
Yeah
Murda on tha beat, so it's not nice

That's Baka, he's a no-long-talker
Quick to let a motherfuckin' TEC slam
We don't need to hear about a next man
Youts talk down, then they get ran
Left them, get dipped from the whole ends
If Gilla call shots, no questions
G-Way 'til I'm restin'
But we still got love for the West End
If it's a chit-chat ting, better talk nice
Murda on the beat, so it's not nice
Skull gets hot, then I'm not nice
You tryna date her and she been, let me walk twice
Now you man are on a diss ting
Just know man like Chubbs
He's a fixer if I ever gotta fix tings
Just know man like Fifth, he's a sicko
As you get tanned, he don't miss things
Just know man like me, I'm a Sixer
And I oversee the whole thing
Yeah, I pree the whole thing
Yeah, I pree the whole thing
Preme got the hurt tucked, can't see the whole thing
Niggas wanna talk splits, now we need the whole thing

Man gets duppied when we touch a button
Man catch suckers, then we're touchin' somethin'
Man gets stuck in, yeah, we're stuck in somethin'
Man gets rappin' when we're suckin' somethin'
Man gets battered with the crutch or somethin'
Man bat bat it, then we buck or somethin'
If man child play it, then we Chucky somethin'
If man start throwin', then we're chuckin' somethin'
I'm on the best side, got the TEC lined
In the whip, on the left side, on a death ride
MAC-10 and the spesh flies, and the TEC slide
Nutty shit like somethin' just climbed out the X-Files
Textbook, like it's old school, like in textiles
Lightie, lookin' healthy and she gets smiles
Home time, grab a quick drink and she gets wild
Sexy, and I rate that and her sex style
Fuckin' somethin', yeah nigga, fuckin' somethin'
Back bent, pussy, I'll fuck her somethin'
Cognac, better grab a cup of somethin'
Glue pussy like a nigga stuck or somethin'
Stuck or somethin', like a nigga stuck or somethin'
So the monster is like a truck or somethin'
Spread the pussy out, I'm 'bout to butter somethin'
Man gone Hollywood, it's like I'm Buck or somethin'

You dun know, it's Hollowman Giggs
Right now, just here with the big man Drizzy, you get me?
More Life flex, you dun know
OVO and SN1 to the world, brap
