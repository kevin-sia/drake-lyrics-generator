What if I kissed you right now
How would we explain it
Trying to imagine how it might sound
If I just yelled out

What if I kissed you right now
Would it bring us any closer
Take the weight off of our shoulders
Take me I'm yours
And I don't really care who knows it
Can we afford to be that open with all these emotions

If you were a secret
How long could you keep it
Keep it to yourself
Don't tell nobody else

Nothing but mine,
Talking 'bout mine,
Now you're all mine
And you… you, you…

And you just be mine (just be mine)
And you just be mine all mine
And you just be mine (just, just be mine)
And you just be mine all mine

What if I kissed you right now

Would it bring us any closer
Take the weight off of our shoulders
Tell on me I don't mind
'Cause if they ask me about it I won't lie

Admit that I'm yours
I don't really care who knows it
Can we afford
To be that open with all these emotions

If we were a secret
Tell me could you keep it?
Keep it to yourself
Don't tell nobody else

Nothin' but mine,
Talking 'bout mine,
Now you're all mine
And you… you, you…

Just be mine (just be mine)
And you just be mine all mine
And you just be mine (just, just be mine)
And you just be mine all mine yeah

What if I kissed you right now
What if I kissed you right now

Just be mine
And you just be mine all mine
And you just be mine
And you just be mine all mine

Just be mine
And you just be mine all mine
And you just be mine
And you just be mine all mine

If we were a secret
Tell me could you keep it?
Keep it to yourself
Don't tell nobody else

Nothing but mine,
Talking 'bout mine,
Now you're all mine
And you… you, you…

Just be mine (just be mine)
And you just be mine all mine
And you just be mine (just, just be mine)
And you just be mine all mine yea

What if I kissed you right
