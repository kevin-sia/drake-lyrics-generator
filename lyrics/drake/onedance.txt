Baby I like your style

Grips on your waist
Unruly me say
This sound just done the place
Streets not safe
Papi never run away
Even when he's away
Oti, oti, there's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray

That's why I need a one dance
Papi got that Hennessy in his hand
What sound can test? I don't know
Watch the whole dance get turned over
Said I need a one dance
Papi got that Hennessy in his hand
What sound can test? I don't know
Watch the whole dance get turned over

Mixpak sound
Baby I like your style
Ya unruly mudas!

Strength and guidance
Next soundbwoy is not my friend
Metro not smoke, so his yiy change
Unruly gang, worldwide ting
Don't know why they still try me
Bun Vegas, he cyaan reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
Unruly time

That's why I need a one dance
Drizzle got the machine in his hand
What sound can test? I don't know
Watch the whole dance get turned over
Said I need a one dance
Papi got that Hennessy in his hand
What sound can test? I don't know
Watch the whole dance get turned over, say

Got a pretty girl and she love me long time
Wine it, wine it, very long time
Oh yeah, very long time
My brudda
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Wicked, wicked, wicked
Back up, back up and wine it, girl
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Drizzy Drake, Popcaan, mudas
Oh yeah, very long time
Back, up, back up and wine it, girl
