This is all God's doing man you can't plan it
But if the devil's in the details then I'm satanic
Bout to take over your city and you can't stand it
My accountant say you sinking like the Titanic
David Blaine last summer man you had to vanish
I get the hits like somebody pitching underhanded
Got my Spanish ting convinced that I know Spanish
Really when she get to talking I don't understand it
You ain't own it right away, you had to wait on niggas
Man I'm only 29 have some patience with us
Plus I never met nobody from my label nigga
I just pop up with the music then they pay a nigga yeah
Shit ain't been the same like before
I still love it but I used to love it more
Face time with my shawty on tour
And she texting purple hearts cause she know that we at war, yeah

Niggas keep reaching and dissin'
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end
Make me call my bros for assistance
You gon make me call my bros for assistance
Niggas keep reaching and dissin'
Put me in a fucked up position
You gon make me call my bros, for assistance
Make me call my bro

Baby I'm a savage I ain't romantic
When I come around these rappers niggas start to panic
And they pockets going under like the Titanic
Got some head last night and it was outstanding'
They was hatin' on me then and they hatin' now
She was playing with me then but she waitin' now
Used to sleep inside a den I got acres now
I was fighting niggas then but I'm spraying now (blasting)
I don't pay no mind to no sneak diss
I won't spend a dime on a freak bitch
Niggas takin' cheap shots on some cheap shit
They the type to stand in line for some free shit
Babygirl gon suck it til her jaws locked
She gon' make me put my bitch on call block
We the ones poppin', we the ones shoppin'
We the one droppin', niggas we the ones
They the ones duckin' when them heaters come
You that nigga snitchin' on your people huh
21 savage aka the reaper huh
Pussy niggas gettin' shot for all that reachin' huh

Niggas keep reaching and dissin'
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end
Make me call my bros for assistance
You gon make me call my bros for assistance
Niggas keep reaching and dissin'
Put me in all fucked up position
Make me call my bros, for assistance
Make me call my bro

I dont need love I'm the goat
I just hit the beat and float
And I'm selling out arenas, but you putting on a show
I been trynna change life around for everyone I know
Cause if I don't share the wealth, then how the fuck we supposed to grow
Mom's stressed theres a lot of things we need
Chain smoking in the house it's hard to breathe
I used to have to hit my T's with Febreeze
Jordan pull up in the TL now I'm cheese
I'mma turn this TSX to a Benz soon
I'mma see a lot of blessings for my friends soon
150 inch screen in my bedroom
6'1" man that nigga need some leg room
Shit ain't been the same like before
They ain't even wanna look up at the score
Face time with my shawty on tour
And she texting purple hearts cause she know that we at war

Niggas keep reaching and dissin'
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end
Make me call my bros for assistance
You gon make me call my bros for assistance
Niggas keep reaching and dissin'
Put me in all fucked up position
Make me call my bros, for assistance
Make me call my bro
