P.S. 111 at free lunch, embarrassed but managed to get a plate
We was kids hungry, Mom's working I was famished, she getting home late
So I decided now I'm in charge
Either stay full of starve, corner store like Mr. Spare-a-Quarter
Before Air Jordans, Kareem Abdul-Jabbars
Trying to cop quarters and trying to move that hard
Roll with a shooting squad
How could I not succumb? How could I not partake?
15 I got a gun, 16 I robbed a train
Licked off a shot for fun, what's got inside my brain?
A hustler's job ain't done, 'til he becomes a king
But I'm a righteous son, despite I'm in the mist of
Dudes who switch up and change
They want to carry me like I'm some kind of lame
I never let them know, I just forgive them though
Either that or the pistol blow

I remember early mornings - syrup sandwiches, sugar water, yeah
Walking up the dark stairwells, elevators was out of order, yeah
Worth 200 million now, bicentennial nigga, flat screens and condominiums
Brazilian women on Xannies they pulling off panties
I'm pushing 40, she only 21
Don't applaud me, I'm exhausted G
Me and my red cup, my blunt and my red cup
Y'all wouldn't know me without one, I keep a fresh cut
Remember talking to Biggie inside his Lex truck
Said stay fly when you bummy, keep your pajamas Armani
Hood forever, I just act like I'm civilized
Really what's in my mind is organizing a billion black motherfuckers
To take over JP and Morgan Goldman and Sachs
And teach the world facts and give Saudi they oil back

1990's Polo Ralph Lauren on him
Gone a few years, the whole world snoring on him
Girls all up on him, I spread them, hit them and dead them
She says, "third leg from a legend is sheer heaven"
She says, "it is the greatest loving"
The tales you hear is the truth, on me
Who wasn't the most faithful husband
Reveal my life, you will forgive me
You will love me, hate me, judge me, relate to me
Only a few will, this how it sounds when you too real
They think it's just music still
Well I am a graphic classic song composer
Music notes on sheets, I wrote this piece to get closure
Some of y'all might know Kelis - this goes to her with love
Also goes to y'all, let's see
The craziest things already happened to me
So either you'll be laughing at me or you're laughing with me, ha
