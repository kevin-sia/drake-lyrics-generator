Oooooooooooh!

Maxwell go and sing

Ooohh, this for the ladies

M-A-X

Doin' it

N-A-S

I'm back again (who's back)
Again, again, I'm back again (who's back)
Ooh, tell me (who's back)
I'm back again (who's back)
Again, again, I'm back again

Uh, yeah the booty is the bass
The highs, the beauty in ya eyes
First glance I became alive
She went through a lot of dangerous guys, surprise
Now she went to side on Nas
Cause I ain't choose her, she chose me
In the party, it was a early day a March
When I first had ya legs arched
In the park, wasn't even dark
We was in the zone, we ain't care who watch
Baby was ?? though the trees was sparked
She said till you get enough, please don't stop
So I played wit it, got the moist spot hot
If I ain't hittin' the bottom, I'm getting some top
My hair cut look air brushed
Whatever I wear is straight plush from the ears to chucks
As we ?? across the dance floor
Just, me and you no one else but us to

No other girl in the room
No other girl in the room but you
(There's no other girl lookin' as good as you)
There's nobody but you
(They can try, they can try)
No other girl in the room
(But you know, you know, you know)
No other girl in the room
(Oh, oh, ooo ooo)
No other girl in the room but you
(There's no other girl, no)
There's nobody but you
(They try)
No other girl in the room
(There's nobody to,)

In the early eighties, shorty had me off the wall
A super freak as my thoughts revolved
It's like a menage Winona Gaye and Leila Hathaway
Both they fathers a tell me to play, sip ??
On our honeymoon everyday
We dance to the same tune everyday
Beauty and the goon they would say
You promise, savage beast
You a sexy freak
Your moist lips negates the ecstacy
Number one in my book, no discrepancy
When you walk on the earth, you be reppin' me
I'm obsessed with thee, cherish every breath you breathe
No matter what's going on around us
All I could hear was the sound of (her)
Twirlin' her around just (her)
See nobody in the crowd just (her)

(No other)
No other girl in the room
(No one)
No other girl in the room but you
(There's no other girl)
There's nobody but you
(Thinkin' about you baby, baby)
No other girl in the room
(Never ever, ever, ever, see you)
No other girl in the room
(Oh)
No other girl in the room but you
(No other girl has, they're not you)
There's nobody but you
(Oooh baby yeah)
No other girl in the room

Uh, horns!
Clap
Everybody clap
C'mon, clap
Max mellow I'm out

Oh it's just my, it's just my, it's just my girl
Oh, it's just, just my, just my baby, you
Just you, just me, no one else but you
No one, no one, just me and you, oh babe

Clap!  Break it down

You know it all comes from Africa
But my version is the blues
