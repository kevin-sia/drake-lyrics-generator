Say hello to the man, goodbye to the gigolo
It was difficult for me to find a chick I want

This ain't no sucka for love shit
This ain't no Huxtable kisses and hug shit, first night we fuck shit
And don't call the next day, this a thug's wedding day
And love, will we make it? Let us pray...
In a limo, my niggas, my father, my brothers
Everybody in tuxes gettin' blunted
Hard Bottasmov costumes, this ain't no act, though
Factual, the pimp shall scoop no more
Yes, I'm absolutely sure
I know that she love me, I know that she faithful
We spoke on a prenuptial agreement cuz Will and Jada ain't need it
Spoke on eloping but then I deaded the thought
Cuz she deserves Cinderella's Ball and the whole shit
But know this, you fuckin' wit a slit ya throat quick
Behicular explosions, cigar smokin'
Dark-minded, chart climbin, well-spoken
Safer world of broke men to rich ones
Throw them phone numbers away cuz this is it, hun
Headed to the Chapel, my niggas laughin
And it's bafflin cuz just a year ago
It's weird, though, I knew I'd get married
To who? I knew not, thought of snatchin Halle up from the dreadlock
Pumpin' Sade, my head knot
Finally, I met the perfect bitch, pardon my french, rephrase that 
Someone who made my heart stop, couldn't wait to blaze that
Tired of hoppin' from honey to honey
HIV spreadin', everybody bump the same bunnies
The game'll put niggas in they graves right before they part ways with the street
I want a son to greet every mornin'
Daughters and more sons tickle my feet
Wife smilin', tellin' me it's time to eat
I'm gettin' married

It was my dream for my queen to put the ring on the ride
Even Marrin Luther King had a fling on the side
That's what the negative ones say
Knew my wedding would be one day but quickly is this day
I know the hoes gonna miss me
Lookin' at old photos, sayin, "Damn, used to twist me"
Start chokin' up since I woke up
Bachelor Party was crazy, tryin' hard just to sober up
Father saw me in a daze, knudged me with his left arm
Told me how him and moms went to City Hall, dressed norm'
Said she would love me and my eyes were boating
Customized in London by guys who suit up kings
Gov', you got the ring, Jung', you behave
Maxwell, he gon' sing, invited Lauryn Hill and the gang
Baltimore, North Cacky', Mississippi
Family packed in, my nigga, L is crazy tipsy
Spilled Pepsi on the cufflinks, ginger ale got it out
Watched in the church, just all big to thug it out
My girl walked in glistenin', different stones
'Bout to go from my fiance to Mrs. Jones
That's a union nobody can touch
I gotta be cool wit' ya crazy aunts and uncles
Cuz I love you much...cuz you put up wit my shit
Court cases, baby mommas
I make an honest woman outta you yet
Everybody starin' at you, I'm at the alter, standin'
Heart poundin' out my chest like a cannon
I'm happy, one of my Groom's men
Under the music says, "Don't do it"
But they just joke, some crew shit
They playin, I'm gleeful, I'm stayin'
I'm sayin' vows that are all true
"Will you take music as your wedded wife?"
"I do."
Sike, this ain't about music, y'all know who I'm talkin' to

Gettin' married
