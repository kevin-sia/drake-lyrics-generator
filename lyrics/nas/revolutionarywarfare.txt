 uh uh huh, lets go, yeah!
 Uh, ghetto children singing "singing"
 See they eager to learn "uh hum"
 how to become the next world leaders "Bravehearts"!


Revolutionary warfare is all fair loving war for the cause
I gotta take you off here
Revolutionary warfare is all fair loving war for the cause
I gotta take you off here


Book one, strategy, tactics, techniques
Look dumb, but massively notice the weakness, in all them
Gotta shoot only if necessary 
Homey vest is very real if enemies carrying heavy steal
Beware the thugs who ain't scared of blood or jail time
Where Arian nations ain't having integration, we so blind
The beauty of life, was when my mom said nigga you could be Christ
I wasn't old enough to hold my dick and pee right, "Jesus"!
What is he like? I picture him standing with diamonds on him
Little different from the way my mommy saw him
Practice your aiming, physical training in, difficult terrain and
Test your endurance, try to keep your stamina banging
Splitting dutches up, strap up, the armies is school 
Teaching smart ways to kill, I'm thinking Ghandi was a fool
But chronic's a fool; got me thinking out loud, fuck it
Sleep on my drunkenness I'll blow your brains out 


My revolution is as real as Bobby Seale's, I build
With dudes and cribs worth a quarter mill, in dix hills
for fish scale, to cop guns, the time come
I'll mask up and get my comrade off the bus
Fuck the beef I'll snatch your seed, from chuckie cheese 
And feed him to the rats in the back of the P's 
Black fatigues and ? on the sofa
50 inch flat screen Louie Vitton holdsters
My motions don't appeal to repel at divisions
I did it strong for 7 long years in prison, fuck the system
I'm like a modern day Hitler, black gorilla, crip and blood in one nigga
Only killas know my face
I beat a case for shooting at the police, nigga, the name Lake
Though simultaneously the street revolution 
21 gun salute the new Huey Newton 

 Teach y'all women how to hold the family down in case something happens to his fathers
 Protect the children, grab revolvers
 The women plays important part of our life force
 So what we fight for, my heart goes to you beautiful wife in war
 Uh, And listen more talk less
 Watch all and trust none, demand your respect
 And be ready to die for what you believe in
 And ride all the time not just when convenient 
 Justice and freedom, wisdom and understanding
 We the lost children of Israel in this western world region
 You ain't a man you a coward if you cant support the girl you put a seed in
 Strong rule the weak, but the wise rule the strong
 It's more to a war than just getting it on
 Conceal your form, cover your tracks
 Stay prepared I don't care if no one's spared
