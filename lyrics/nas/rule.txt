Oooh oooh, oooooooooooooooohhhhhhhh! The stuggles of life! (Life!)
Oooh, oooh, oooh, da da da da da da! (Everything I ever wanted)
Oh, oh (Yeah Yeah!) Do do do do do do! (Yeah! My life, so real)

Before I use to dream I could rule the world
Now it's thoro I survived the perils in my fly apparel
Seven forty five appeal, no candy paint no chrome wheels
I Close deals tried to see my face on my own bills
The president here, he's honest and fair
Prayed for the days, when the kins of slaves is honered and shared
January 20th I was there
I'm aware the part I played to get young voters to care
Recession is a blessin in disguise
For a new economy to rise somethin old has to die
I'm still sippin Rose' PJ's it be's like that
I brung the eighty seven Fila's back
Save collect, B.I.G.'S dream came correct
Tryin to put seven hundreds, they made them yes
I used to think United College Fund was for bums (Nah)
The ghetto advocate for education look what I become

Before I use to dream I ruled the world
{I use to have to imagine, now I can actually have it}
So here I am, to rule the world, world
But now you used to dream you ruled the world
(Now, you, use, to, dream, you, ruled, the, world!)
{I use to dream} (Ruled the world)
So here we are, are, are, are (Yeah! Here we are!)

I don't say I'm maintainin, that's a lame's language (word)
Poor English, from a wise man I learned paitence
Me not distinguished, is like a fiendless Queensbridge
I don't say I'm grindin, 'cause everything I do is redefining
'Cause when you know the streets to the science
Apply it very moderate, 'til your business'll watch you profit
Rap game, NBA to NFL, the kids'll yell, "Will I win? "
The fella ends up in the cell - nonsense
'Cause they can grow to be part of the Congress
Be responsive, to these inner-city problems
Behind a tent with a chauffer, I rep for the culture
Rep for the thugs and STILL see eye to eye with Oprah
I was a dreamer a wisher would hope for
A better life for these kids while I sip on a Mosa
I plan yo, you should watch the black and white's hand, yo
Who's the best? Next to me, they couldn't light a candle
Yep!

Before I use to dream I ruled the world
{I use to have to imagine, now I can actually have it}
So here I am, to rule the world, world
But now you used to dream you ruled the world
(Now, you, use, to, dream, you, ruled, the, world!)
{I use to dream} (I Ruled the world)
So here we are, are, are, are (Arrrrreeeeeeee!)

You can be who you wanna, say what you wanna (Marsha!)
Tryna make it better, our sons and our daughters (Yeah!)
Use your mind - make a change
Yes, we can - see a brighter day
Gon' be struggle, gon' be pain
But no excuses to be made
This is the time that we've been waiting foooooooooor!

I done seen it all, I got it on with the weak and strong
There's no relief, it's like the beef keeps keepin on
I can't count the amount I drew heaters on
'Cause we was warrin in the Ps', it was Vietnam
Now I got you in arenas, watchin me perform
The songs rappin 'bout them same beefs and the street I'm from
Thankful, for the art form I'm eatin from
I never see no losses, I only see we won - yeah

Before I use to dream I ruled the world
{I use to have to imagine, now I can actually have it}
So here I am, to rule the world, world
But now you used to dream you ruled the world
(Now, you, use, to, dream, you, ruled, the, world!)
{I use to dream} (I Ruled the world)
So here we are, are, are, are (Here we are this day!)
Before I use to dream I ruled the world
{I use to have to imagine, now I can actually have it}
So here I am, to rule the world, world
But now you used to dream you ruled the world
(Now, you, use, to, dream, you, ruled, the, world!)
{I use to dream} (Oh we come so far!)
So here we are, are, are, are (Here we are this day!)
